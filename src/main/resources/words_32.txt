Supralapsarianism differs from infralapsarianism on the relation of God's decree to human sin. The differences go back to the conflict between Augustine and Pelagius. Before the Reformation, the main difference was whether Adam's fall was included in God's eternal decree; supralapsarians held that it was, but infralapsarians acknowledged only God's foreknowledge of sin. Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin were agreed that Adam's fall was somehow included in God's decree; it came to be referred to as a \"permissive decree,\" and all insisted that God was in no way the author of sin. As a result of the Reformers' agreement, after the Reformation the distinction between infra - and supralapsarianism shifted to differences on the logical order of God's decrees.Theodore Beza, Calvin's successor at Geneva, was the first to develop supralapsarianism in this new sense. By the time of the Synod of Dort in 1618 - 19, a heated intraconfessional controversy developed between infra - and supralapsarians; both positions were represented at the synod. Francis Gomarus, the chief opponent of James Arminius, was a supralapsarian.The question of the logical, not the temporal, order of the eternal decrees reflected differences on God's ultimate goal in predestination and on the specific objects of predestination. Supralapsarians considered God's ultimate goal to be his own glory in election and reprobation, while infralapsarians considered predestination subordinate to other goals. The object of predestination, according to supralapsarians, was uncreated and unfallen humanity, while infralapsarians viewed the object as created and fallen humanity.The term \"supralapsarianism\" comes from the Latin words supra and lapsus; the decree of predestination was considered to be \"above\" (supra) or logically \"before\" the decree concerning the fall (lapsus), while the infralapsarians viewed it as \"below\" (infra) or logically \"after\" the decree concerning the fall. The contrast of the two views is evident from the following summaries.The logical order of the decrees in the supralapsarian scheme is: (1) God's decree to glorify himself through the election of some and the reprobation of others; (2) as a means to that goal, the decree to create those elected and reprobated; (3) the decree to permit the fall; and (4) the decree to provide salvation for the elect through Jesus Christ.The logical order of the decrees according to infralapsarians is: (1) God's decree to glorify himself through the creation of the human race; (2) the decree to permit the fall; (3) the decree to elect some of the fallen race to salvation and to pass by the others and condemn them for their sin; and (4) the decree to provide salvation for the elect through Jesus Christ. Infralapsarians were in the majority at the Synod of Dort. The Arminians tried to depict all the Calvinists as representatives of the \"repulsive\" supralapsarian doctrine. Four attempts were made at Dort to condemn the supralapsarian view, but the efforts were unsuccessful. Although the Canons of Dort do not deal with the order of the divine decrees, they are infralapsarian in the sense that the elect are \"chosen from the whole human race, which had fallen through their own fault from their primitive state of rectitude into sin and destruction\" (I,7; cf.I,1). The reprobate \"are passed by in the eternal decree\" and God \"decreed to leave (them) in the common misery into which they have willfully plunged themselves\" and \"to condemn and punish them forever...for all their sins\" (I,15).", "example" : "Defenders of supralapsarianism continued after Dort. The chairman of the Westminister Assembly, William Twisse, was a supralapsarian but the Westminister standards do not favor either position. Although supralapsarianism never received confessional endorsement within the Reformed churches, it has been tolerated within the confessional boundaries. In 1905 the Reformed churches of the Netherlands and the Christian Reformed Church in 1908 adopted the Conclusions of Utrecht, which stated that \"our Confessional Standards admittedly follow the infralapsarian presentation in respect to the doctrine of election, but that it is evident...that this in no wise intended to exclude or condemn the supralapsarian presentation.\" Recent defenders of

One of these projets is The Pirate Bay, the worlds largest BitTorrent tracker site. Another Swedish project is the famous KaZaA, a peer-to-peer fileshare client. Sweden also produces a lot of good gamers, not seldom seen leading the worldwide scoreboards.

In outline it bears a resemblance to the Persian shamshir and the Turkish kilic; however, the blade of a talwar is wider in the ricasso than a shamshir, and will taper less toward the point. It also has a less extreme curve in the 28-30 inch blade and often will sport one or more fullers. As a single-handed sword the talwar displays a metal hilt with short quillions for the upper guard, and a unique flat-disc pommel. The blade's tang is inserted to the single piece hollow hilt and affixed with adhesive. The blade seems to have been derived from earlier turko-mongol sabers with heavy influence from the Indian khanda. Due to its popularity in India the talwar was found in 19th century Afghanistan, Nepal, Mysore. In addition, it had relatives in the pedeung and the piso podang swords of Sumatra. Like the shamshir, the blades and hilts of the talwar were often very ornate and featured carvings or gilding.

For instance, such a person favours overseas interventions by Soviet-style states, defends these regimes when they engage in human rights violations, and wishes to establish a similar system in other countries such as Britain and America.The term is used to distinguish the rare individuals with these kinds of beliefs from communists more broadly (including Communist Party members), whose adherence to Soviet doctrine and attachment to existing \"socialist\" states is somewhat weaker.It is always more-or-less abusive in the sense that those termed tankies do not use the term themselves, but it doesn't have any particular bite (unlike, say, Trot).The term derives from the fact that the divisions within the communist movement first arose when the Soviet Union sent tanks into communist Hungary in 1956, to crush an attempt to establish an alternative version of communism which was not embraced by the Russians.  Most communists outside the eastern bloc opposed this action and criticised the Soviet Union.  The \"tankies\" were those who said \"send the tanks in\".The epithet has stuck because tankies also supported \"sending the tanks in\" in cases such as Czechoslovakia 1968, Afghanistan 1979, Bosnia and Kosovo/a (in the case of the Serbian state), and so on (whereas the rest of the communist movement has gravitated towards anti-militarism).", "example" : "I wouldn't be surprised if the tankies even defend Saddam Hussein.Some of the people round George W Bush used to be left-wing, but they haven't really changed their views much; they were mostly tankies.", "word" : "tankie"},{"definition" : "comes from mmorpgs, where you would have a healer in your party and a person with high defense.

In fact the spider bites were inflicted by a species of widow spider.  But the widow spiders are small and look insignificant, whilst wolf spiders are bigger and hairy, so the wolf spider was blamed.  To this day many people judge how venomous a spider is on its size, which is completely inaccurate.  Wolf spiders are harmless.  These days the name 'tarantula' is used to describe any spider of the Theraphosid family.  This family has something like 800 known species in Africa, Mid and South America and Asia, with many more no doubt still undiscovered.  The tarantulas (or Theraphosids) are the giants of the spider world, the biggest with leg-spans which could cover a dinner plate (a Goliath Birdeater with a 12-inch leg-span I think is the record).  Though some tarantulas live in trees, most are ground-dwellers and the live in burrows.  They line the entrances of their burrows with silk.  Though tarantulas have no senses of hearing or smell and very poor vision, they have a very developed sense of touch.  The hairs on their legs can detect the slightest air or ground vibration, and the lines of silk they lay down around their burrows are almost like extentions of their legs.  Any small animal touching one of those threads will instantly alert the tarantula.  Tarantulas feed on anything from crickets, locusts and cockroaches to rodents, small snakes and small lizards.  Despite the fact they are often known as 'bird-eating spiders' in the US, it is probably very rare for a tarantula to eat a bird, though tree-climbing tarantulas can easily help themselves to a chick when a parent bird is away from its nest.  With their basic webs they are thought to be the earliest form of spider, date back over 350 million years.  When threatened or annoyed, tarantulas rear up on their back legs and bare their fangs.  Some can even make a hissing/rustling noise by rubbing bristles on their jaws together.  Tarantulas do not eat solid food.  When a tarantula feeds, it injects a digestive fluid into its prey through its fangs.  The prey is then gradually liquidised and absorbed into the mouth in a similar way to water being absorbed into a sponge.  Tarantulas breathe through gill-like openings in the underside of their abdomens called 'book lungs'.  When tarantulas mate, the male inserts sperm from his pedipalps ('feelers') into an opening under the female's body.  Female tarantulas are larger and stronger than the more spindly-looking males, can live anything up to ten or twenty years, maybe longer depending on the species.  Once the male has reached full size he can't hope to live eighteen months at the most.  Despite the hooks on his front legs (for holding the female's fangs) he maybe be eaten after (or even before) mating.  Tarantulas shed their skins, on average once a year.  They can cast off a damaged limb but re-grow it gradually, the new limb becoming bigger every time their shed their skin.  The tarantula skin is an exoskeleton, made of keratin (the same material human nails are made of).  Despite the fear and horror they install in so many people (who've learnt most of what they know about tarantulas from the movies) tarantulas have venom which is unable to endanger human life.  In fact, there is no record of anyone being killed by a tarantula bite.  Some New World species have hairs on their abdomens which they can flick off with their back legs.  These can cause an itching/burning sensation if they come into contact with human skin.  But let's be honest, tarantulas are probably more afraid of us than we are of them, and they are a major controller of destructive pests like cockroaches and locusts.  In fact tarantulas make excellent pets.  They are more likely to run away rather than attack, unless they are cornered.  Tarantulas are certainly not made of rubber, as some movies would have us believe.  They are just as much flesh and blood as we are.", "example" : "A tarantula bite dangerous?

This began at the time of the great flood and continues all the way until they are to be thrown into the abyss with Satan upon the Lord\u2019s day. The misconceptions about Tartarus being an actual place are due to the fact that it was a word taken from Greek mythology with a very similar meaning to Hades. Tartarus was actually the lowest depth of Hades in Greek mythology.\n\nBy rendering Tartarus as \u201chell\u201d in the bible also put a big spin on things. Biblically Tartarus had no connection with mankind, by rendering it as \u201chell\u201d suddenly incorporated demons and mankind in the same place. With a little research, the idea that Tartarus is the same place as both Gehenna and the grave/Hades is complete absurdity.\n\nTake a look at \u20132 Peter 2:4 For God didn't spare the angels who sinned, but threw them down into Tartarus and delivered them to be kept in chains of darkness until judgment;\n\nSee also:\n\nJude 1:6 and He has kept, with eternal chains in darkness for the judgment of the great day, angels who did not keep their own position but deserted their proper dwelling.\n\nThese angels are actually only removed from God\u2019s holy presence, not literal light; hence the description \u201cchains of darkness.\u201d There is no such thing as \u201cchains of darkness\u201d in a literal sense. What this means is that they are \u201cbound\u201d to this darkness. They are no longer aligned with God\u2019s spirit. Tartarus parallels the \u201cspiritual darkness\u201d mankind is living in today when you put the facts about demons together. Mankind is bound to this spiritual darkness in such a way that we can\u2019t get away from it just as demons are bound to their darkness; we have all become independent of God.\n\nNow think about demons for a minute; we know that they are still able to move about the earth and heaven, and are able to possess people as well as animals. Angels are constantly battling amongst each other in the bible -Revelation 12:7-9Then war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels also fought, but he could not prevail, and there was no place for them in heaven any longer. So the great dragon was thrown out\u2014the ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the one who deceives the whole world. He was thrown to earth, and his angels with him.\n\nClearly since Satan and his angels will not be thrown out of heaven until the beginning of the Lord\u2019s Day proves that Satan and his fallen angels were able to move about in heaven for a long time after the flood. So they are not literally in chains down in a dark pit.\n\nPaul also indicated that demons were still in heaven during his day \u2013\n\nEphesians 6:12\n\nFor our battle is not against flesh and blood, but \u2026 against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavens.\n\nAlso refer to Job 1:6-7, Daniel 10:13, and Judges 5:20\n\nIt is stated in the bible that the Heavens have to be cleansed of sin before the Earth can be, therefore the demons were allowed to move about in Heaven for quite some time after these writings. Tartarus cannot be a specific place like the grave, or even hell, where demons would be confined.\n\nThese sinful angels whom Jehovah put into Tartarus are the spirits Jesus made a proclamation to in 1 Peter 3:18-20 once Jehovah resurrected him to spirit form after being dead for three days \u2013\n\nFor Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, after being put to death in the fleshly realm but made alive in the spiritual realm. In that state He also went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison who in the past were disobedient, \u201c\u2026\u201d", "example" : "For God didn't spare the angels who sinned, but threw them down into Tartarus and delivered them to be kept in chains of darkness until judgment;", "word" : "tartarus"},{"definition" : "a prostitute (in the french language)", "example" : "Gosh, your such a tarte, why dont you go down to Harry Heinz Blvd.", "word" : "tarte"},{"definition" : "What you are before you're retarted.", "example" : "First you were plain tarted, now you just retarted, son!", "word" : "tarted"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tartemorion"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tarten"},{"definition" : "a male tart. a male charmer that sleeps around.", "example" : "He is such a tarter charming all the girls.", "word" : "tarter"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tartest"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tartine"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tarting"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tartish"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tartishly"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tartishness"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tartle"},{"definition" : "Verb - A tweenage girl (under 15) who behaves and/or dresses like a tart.", "example" : "Jinkies, look at that tartlet.
