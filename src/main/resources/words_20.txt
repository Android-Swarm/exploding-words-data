As with many subcultures, the defining characteristics are clothing and music, both of which become an obsession for Mods. The clothing has a vintage, well-taylored, and peacockish look, favoring bright patterns, plenty of color, brands like Ben Sherman and Fred Perry, and slim-cut, three button suits (preferrably Italian) in the style of the sixties. The favored music of Mods is varied rather widely but, for the most part, shares the characteristic of being danceable. Favored genres include old school Ska, Soul, and R&B as well as New Wave, Britpop, and some things that, today, are heaped into the rather loose label of \"Alternative Rock\".Another defining characteristic of Mods is their chosen mode of transportation, the Italian moterscooter (most notably Vespa and Lambretta). Not everyone who rides a scooter is Mod, however. These scooters tend to be in a retro style and sometimes heavily customized.Unlike the case with some other social subgroups, there exists no Mod ideology or philosophy(outside of a general avoidance of violence because of unwillingness to damage their clothes and the idea that, as The Who put it in one of their earliest songs \"you gotta be cool\").

It occurs primarily between the ages of 10 and 35 years old. When younger children are infected, it causes little or no illness. Such exposure does, however, create an immunity to the disease. Nearly 90% of Americans have antibodies for mononucleosis by age 40. Mono has an incubation period of 30 to 40 days and the symptoms usually last 7 to 14 days but can last for several weeks. The virus can stay alive within the body for several months. The name mononucleosis comes from the fact that the disease distorts the white blood cells, causing them to only have one nucleus. Only a blood test called the mononucleosis spot test can determine if someone has the disease. SYMPTOMS OF MONONUCLEOSIS  The following symptoms can be present with mono, but most likely not all will be.   Sore throat, usually red   Enlarged lymph nodes in all parts of the body   Fever   Nausea   Loss of appetite   Extreme fatigue   Enlarged spleen (2/3 of mono patients)  Ulceration of the pharynx

Following the publication of 'The Geneology of Morals', his main concern was to reaffirm life in 'the twilight of the idols'. His phrase 'god is dead, we are all his murderers' was not an attack against religion as such, but against nihilism which believed in nothing on the one hand, and on the churches and christians who had sapped the true value and meaning out of life and religion on the other. Thus he claimed the churches were 'sepulchres', and the nihilists he urged to 'keep holy your highest hope'. That hope he grounded in the act of creation, and affirmed in the idea of 'eternal recurrence' - the ultimate affirmation of life. These ideas are best outlined in 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra', in particular the sections  'The Tree on the Mountainside' and 'On the Three Metamorphoses'. In this last section he outlines how the human soul begins as 'a camel' wieghted down by loyalty to the old gods, then he must become a 'lion' and denounce them before becoming 'a child' who creates a new value and new meaning for his life. Nietzsche owed much to Eastern, particularly Buddhist metaphysics, as well, I suspect, as being influenced by William Blake and Wagner. His is the same kind of reaffirming existential mission. His influence on the 20th C. existentialists also mark him out as one of the early 'fathers' of 'postmodernism'.", "example" : "'But by my love and hope I beseech you; Do not throw away the hero in your soul!

Everyone (including whites) can agree that there is a huge difference between \"blacks\" and \"niggers.\" Black people are just hard-workers who contribute to society just like everyone else...Now NIGGERS, are the gang-banging, uneducated, welfare-abusing, cap-popping, thuggin', no-good, drug-selling/using, nothing-but-rap-listening, terrible parenting, never-want-to-get-ahead-in-life blacks, that nobody wants around...not even regular blacks.Any Black person who has sense, will NEVER use that word in a positive manner (this means the word \"nigga\"). If you want to associate someone with being your close friend, use the term \"friend,\" not \"my nigga!\" It makes you sound and look like an idiot.

And I think it's dumb that black people can use the most terrible word in the English language to CALL each other, even though no other race does that!! When comedians are onstage, it's perfectly natural to laugh when the black comedian says \"whitey/Redneck.\" But when a white person calls a black person \"nigger,\" lawsuits are filed, and all hell breaks loose.
