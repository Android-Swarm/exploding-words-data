Going by the Turkic/Mongolian origin of their name, the Cossacks may have originated in Central Asia, and migrated into the Slavic lands as nomads, perhaps on the heels of the Mongol invasions.  Historically, the Cossacks were predominantly Russian Orthodox Christian, but there were a few, especially around Crimea, who were Muslim, and some were even Buddhists from Mongolia.Most early accounts of the Cossacks come from those who fought them, and recount their brutality and the use of bull whips as a battlefield weapon.  Later accounts come from Russian officers who fought alongside the Cossacks during Napoleon's invasion of Russia.  The Cossacks fought alongside the Russian army as late as WWI.  In the Revolution, the Cossacks aligned with the Czar, and committed numerous acts of brutality against anyone suspected of Communist sympathies.

Pure cryolite itself melts at 1012 °C, and it can dissolve the aluminium oxides sufficiently well to allow easy extraction of the aluminium by electrolysis.

Eventually it may grow into true love or your feelings might wear away so don't jump into conclusions and mistake a silly crush for love. A crush might make you get butterflies in  your stomach, shy, and blushful. Your crush can also cause you to do silly things like stalking him,figuring out his/her sceduled classes, looking at his/her myspace a million times a day (even reading all his/her comments), collecting every piece of information you can on him/her, and other obsessive things. There is a reason why a crush is called a crush though. It might hurt to find out your crush is taken--OUCH! But if you are truely still into this person DON'T let that stop you. There is still hope for the future. Until your desired lover is single again try developing a frienship! That way you'll always be an option. Good luck! ( :Ps-Don't go OD on the stalker thing.

Thus:Curatage: (syn. curatorship, curating): In the visual arts, the act of using a curator to remove or prevent the propagation of art material that does not properly commodify or monetize. In an ideal world curatage is performed by a trained and competent aesthetician, but the ballooning academicism, obscurantism and insularity of the high art world and the common currency of terms such as \u201cgatekeeper\u201d, \u201cgallerist\u201d or \u201csheep\u201d attest to the fact that this is not always the case. Indeed, with the decline of traditional media, brick and mortar marketing and the dilution of academic and professional credentials the traditional reliance on curatage in some areas of the visual arts may be waning.", "example" : "The gallery director's curatage, informed by entrepreneurial instinct and natural salesmanship, avoided the near disaster of displaying a collection of one-off pieces that lacked sufficient fungibility to support successful marketing and promotion.", "word" : "curatage"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curate"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatel"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curates"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curateship"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatess"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatial"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatic"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatical"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curation"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curative"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatively"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curativeness"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatives"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatize"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatolatry"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curator"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatory"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatorial"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatorium"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curators"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatorship"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatrices"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curatrix"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "curavecan"},{"definition" : "Placing someones open mouth on the corner of a curb so that they are open jawed across the cement.

However, in the long run, cutting can lead to more severe depression and also can cause permanent physical damage.  Cutting sometimes is accompanied by head banging, burning, or other self-destructive behaviors.      Despite some of the close minded definitions, cutting is not done only by emo kids. Although some emo kids do cut, most of the characteristics of cutters are the same as those with eating disorders. Cutters tend to be perfectionists, and often are white, middle class teenage girls, although not all cutters come from this background.       Cutting often is a result of depression, and some view it as a way to release emotional pain when it feels like you would explode otherwise.  Although many people think that those with depression have experienced huge tramas in their lives, this is not necessarily the case.  Depression is a disease, just like diabetes is a disease.  It can strike anyone, regardless of their gender, class, or social status.  I personally am attending an ivyleague college next year, was captain of my soccer team in high school, could be considered among the popular kids at my school, and have an extremely loving family. I still have the scars from my cutting, which I stopped doing 2 months ago.  Although i was lucky enough to be able to stop, other people such as my older sister, became addicted.
