It may be to walk a certain distance carrying very heavy handles in both hands (farmer's walk), to pull a truck, to lift round stones on podiums (the atlas stones), to press an axle or some other implement overhead for a max single or max reps... There are many more kinds of events. You also see standard barbell lifts, often the deadlift, done for a max weight or max reps.\n\nThe strongman needs to be extremely strong in the basic movement patterns, sturdy enough to endure the relentless, cumulative punishment of several taxing events done over the same day or even two days in a row, and fit enough to perform well in a fatigued state. The media give more exposure to the giant men competing in the World's Strongest Man, but there are different weight classes.

After the 'passing away' of the Buddha his remains were cremated and the ashes divided and buried under eight stupas with two further stupas encasing the urn and the embers.They evolved into large hemispherical mounds with features such as the torana (gateway), the vedica (fence-like enclosure evolved from the vedic villages), the harmika (a square platform with railings on top of the stupa), chattrayashti (the parasol or canopy) and a circumambulatory around the stupa. From the first century BCE onwards, stupas were incorporated into the hall of the chaitya-griha.The oldest known stupa is the Dhamek Stupa at Sanchi, India, while the tallest is the Phra Pathom Chedi in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand, with a height of 127 metres.The stupa evolved into the pagoda as Buddhism spread to other Asian countries. The pagoda has varied forms that also include bellshaped and pyramidal ones. Today, in the Western context, there is no clear distinction between the stupa and the pagoda. But in general stupa is used for a Buddhist structure of India or south-east Asia, while pagoda refers to a building in east Asia which can be entered and which may be secular in purpose.Fundamentally, a stupa is essentially made up of the following five constituents:a). A square baseb). A hemispherical domec). A conical spired). A crescent moone). A circular discEach of these components is rich in metaphoric content and is identified with one of the five cosmic elements said to make up the entire manifested existence.

It occurs somewhat oddly in English because in many persons and tenses, the same form is used for indicative and subjunctive verbs.  It is used primarily to express events that are contrary to fact or, if set in the future tense, uncertain.  This is why one says \"If I were...\" instead of \"If I was...\" though the latter is not always incorrect.  The conditional word \"if\" often introduces a contrary to fact or uncertain condition, but it can also express a certain condition (usually when it could be replaced with \"when\") thus: \"If it were raining, I would be happy\" versus \"If it was raining, I was happy.\"  The verbs of the first are in the present tense and subjunctive mood, the second in the past tense and indicative mood.  The first expresses the idea that if it were raining (but it's not), I would be happy (but I am not happy).  The second expresses the idea that whever in the past it was raining, I was happy.  Subjunctives are also used to express hortitory and jussive ideas such as \"God save the queen.\"  Using the subjuctive, one says \"It is imperative that he read this\" rather than \"It is imperative that he reads this,\" but it is never used with the \"that\" of indirect statement.  The subjunctive mood is rarely used or correctly formed in conversational English (and many popular works of literature).", "example" : "Incorrect: If I was rich, I would not live in a box.Correct: If
