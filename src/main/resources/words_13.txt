Majority of expulsion will accumulate approximately four inches below middle of the back of the rim.  Expulsion will form similar to a golf ball cut in half suspended one-half inch above the water level.  Will almost always require multi-flushes to destroy the evidence.  Massive jetsam will be accompanied by a heavy, bestial musk.  Bystanders can often tell when the fury has been wrought by the distinctive funk.The Fury can be rated on a simple base-ten rating system:1.  Burning exploding nuggets, pellet-sized, light brown.3.  Bigger pellets, more gaseous.  Increased decibel level of flatulence.5.  Begins occurrence of multiple rounds of audible droppings.  Pellet size stays the same, enormous quantities of flatus.  Begins increase of liquid excrement.7.  Two onslaughts of nearly maximum size pellets, at least two pints of liquid excrement, and a combined minimum of 20 seconds of total powerful flatus.10.  (Vesuvial):  Three massive and distinct onslaughts incorporating at least two logs of a five inch minimum, at least ten three-quarter inch diameter pellets, at least two quarts of liquid, and at least 45 seconds of pungent flatus.  Level of toilet bowl must rise (by solid displacement) at least two and one-half inches.  Solids should be black or nearly black (completing color shift from light brown to black).  Visible layer of fluids should be floating (immiscible) on top of water.  First impression should make one think of logs and pebbles of feces marinating in an acidic stew of filth.  Bystanders, upon viewing sample, should at least gag.  Inconceivable amount of excrement.  Only one recorded count of the vesuvius in modern history.

Even within the furry fandom, people cannot always agree on just what makes a person a furry or not.Some would argue that to be a furry, you must think and talk like one (i.e. use furry specific words and phrases). Even if you go to conventions, wear a fursuit, draw the art, writes the stories etc but don't talk using furry lingo, you're not a furry. Basically, someone that may walk the walk but doesn\u2019t talk the talk.Others would argue that even liking anthropomorphic creatures makes you a furry. You may have no idea the furry fandom exists or have ever heard of a furry convention, let alone any of the websites; simply liking 'anthro' critters makes you a furry.The way I see it, if or if you don\u2019t consider yourself a furry is a matter of personal opinion.As with any hobby, most furries are normal people just like anyone you'll meet at work/school or going to/from work/school or anywhere. Then there is the small percent that are hard core fans and have taken what for most is a hobby and perverted it (sometimes in an all to literal sense). As is with so many other things in life, the few that take it too far tend to be the loudest. The silent majority are often forced into silence by the loud majority for fear that people will label them as being in the same class as the minority that have perverted it.One unfortunate side effect of the internet and the relative anonymity that some sites grant their users is people are able to engage in activities (even if only on a virtual level) that they would never even consider doing in real life. An example of this is trolls of message boards that say things to people they\u2019d never say to them in person. I think a lot of the stereotypes associated with furries are because of this.In conclusion, as with any hobby, there are some furries that have taken it too far and/or perverted what for many is a fun harmless hobby.", "example" : "If only the silent majority were not so silent, people would realise there is more to furries then perversion.", "word" : "furry"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "furrier"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "furriered"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "furriery"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "furrieries"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "furriers"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "furriest"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "furrily"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "furriner"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "furriners"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "furriness"},{"definition" : "Having sexual intercourse in the wild dressed up as an animal.

There was an enormous amount of trash made by Jerusalem, and they used this entire valley to burn their trash. There was always a fire in this valley; it never stopped burning, so it must have seemed to be unquenchable. Imagine looking down into a valley and instead of seeing the valley flooded with water, you see it flooded with fire. This valley must have appeared to be a lake of fire to onlookers. Everything was thrown into it to be completely destroyed; rubbish, trash, even dead bodies of criminals and those deemed unworthy of a proper burial.\n\nAmong the Israelites a burial in a memorial tomb symbolized righteousness for the one being buried. This was not scriptural, just their way of showing that they considered a person to be worthy of a resurrection. So for a corpse to be condemned into the seemingly eternal fire of a trash dump was the opposite of that. For someone to be thrown into Gehenna symbolized the resident\u2019s abhorrence of this person. If the fire didn\u2019t burn up their corpses, they were on display for everyone to see the maggots eating them. This was the place where the worms never died and the fire never went out. You could always find both of these things in this valley. (Isaiah 66:24) This is something that these guys were familiar with, so what better for Jesus to reference in order to get his point across? Jesus used this trash dump as an illustration to explain how everything that is no part of his Father\u2019s kingdom will be shamefully discarded in the same way.\n\nWhen Jesus spoke of people who were fit for Gehenna the fire, he was speaking of shameful people who were not deemed worthy of a resurrection. There were only twelve instances in the Greek Scriptures speaking of Gehenna. In the manuscripts that render Sheol, Hades, and Gehenna as \u201chell,\u201d these are the twelve scriptures where hell gets completely different characteristics applied to it, misleading many people.\n\nTo be in Sheol/Hades meant to be in a good place in God\u2019s memory and promised a resurrection, as seen at Revelation 20:13. On the other hand, to be in Gehenna meant to be in a bad place in God\u2019s memory and therefore denied a resurrection, as seen at Matthew 23:15. Yet both of these places with absolute opposite meanings are commonly rendered as \u201chell.\u201d\n\nBrimstone, a.k.a. sulphur, was frequently added to Gehenna to heat the fire up and to keep it going, especially when there was nothing to burn. Sulphur gets really hot and burns for a long time, and it takes temperatures of 3000-5000 degrees to burn a human body quickly and completely, so you can appreciate why it was frequently added to completely destroy corpses. Gehenna was later described as \u201cthe Lake of Fire and Sulphur.\u201d Revelation 21:8\n\nGod even spoke of living people being burned in Gehenna as sacrifice and said that he never even considered doing such a thing \u2013\n\nThey have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom in order to burn their sons and daughters in the fire, a thing I did not command; I never entertained the thought. Jeremiah 7:31\n\nAlso - They have built high places to Baal on which to burn their children in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, something I have never commanded or mentioned; I never entertained the thought.

Many of these beings are restless because they do not know that they have passed on due to unexpected events that ended their lives, or believe they have unfinished business to attend to. Many occupy places they frequented during life. Some do know that they are dead, and may come back for reasons of revenge, or to comfort or warn a loved one of some kind of impending disaster, or to lead them to some fortune or treasure. Others just like to hang around and see what's going on with other people. The ghosts who do the same things over and over again are the ones who don't know that they are dead, and are actually prisoners of their own minds: It may be the year 2006, but in the mind of the ghost of a person who died 100 years ago and didnt expect or realize it, it's still 1906 and he's still trying to perform whatever action he was preoccupied with when he died. They can also be called forth by seances and Ouija boards, but you better know what you're doing when you call forth a spirit. If you're poorly prepared, if not at all, you could bring upon yourself some really weird and terrifying results that will not go away. It has happened, people.2)A residual is a ghost that has no intelligence behind its actions. It acts just like a ghost trapped in its own mental prison of time, the difference being that a residual is psychic energy imprinted on the fabric of time and space, stress being the factor that does the impression. In the mind of the person who was performing the action at the time, whatever it might have been, that action, or the situation the person may have been in at the time had some kind of significance to him, and his stress levels may have been up enough to leave an imprint of that certain event or situation. You could call it a \"psychic rerun.\"3)Everyone knows about haunted houses. Not only human spirits can haunt houses, locations or anything, for that matter. Demons can too. In fact, Houses with the strangest and most terriying hauntings are probably infested with demons. People who have died from things going on in the houses they lived in that were haunted were more than likely murdered by a demon, either directly or by someone else who was demon-possessed. Human ghosts haunting a house can be influenced by a demon haunting the same house to kill or otherwise harm the living inhabitants. Manifestations of angels, Jesus, the Virgin Mary or a saint can also be called ghosts, but the proper term for these holy manifestations is apparition.4)A poltergeist is not really a ghost at all, most of the time. While there are accounts of genuine spirits throwing things about, making noises, writing on walls or what have you, most of the time a poltergeist is nothing more than a subconscious manifestation of telekinesis, or the ability to manipilate matter with mental energy alone. This can ahppen when a person is under tremendous mental turmoil or stress. If there is no outlet for this negative buildup of mental energy, the next thing you know the lamp is flying across the living room, and smashes into the wall. This also happens when children enter puberty.

Goalies are expected to play the entire 60 minutes of a given hockey game on the ice.Physical characteristics of most goaltenders include extreme flexibility, due to the necessity to be agile enough to maneuver freely to stop multiple shots in a given game.  Goalies also commonly have above average reflexes, as at the professional level, often are forced to save shots exceeding speeds of 75 mph on a regular basis.Goalies are often considered quirky and highly emotional by nature.  Most goalies employ a very strict set of rituals before games.  The reasoning behind their ritualistic nature is most often in order to prepare them for the game.  Their personalities are often described as bi-polar and many players, including the goalie's teammates, avoid him at almost all costs on game day.  Goalies' dual-sided, unpredictable emotions stem from the fact their job as a goalie is a very high stress-high reward position.

The goatfish will attack from behind, locking its victim in a death grip with horrific fangs nearly 8 inches long. If this does not kill the prey on the first try, the goatfish will play with it, slinging it around in the same way that a dog would play with a chew toy. The victim will then either perish from being torn to pieces or just die from fright.WAYS TO PREVENT GOATFISH ATTACKS:Stay in well lit areas. Goatfish hate any kind of light and will usually back off if any of the stuff gets near them. Never go out alone at night without a flashlight and some form of weapon. Guns are the most effective, especially the shotgun. Goatfish don\u2019t really have any weak spots so knives are pretty much useless. Never travel alone at night, always go in groups.WHAT TO DO IN THE EVENT OF A GOATFISH ATTACK:Wave you arms around in the air and/or make loud noises to try to make yourself look as big as possible. Never try to outrun a goatfish, because you will never be able to. Goatfish have been known to be able to run at speeds exceeding mach 14. If a goatfish ever grabs hold of you, do not struggle. The last thing you want to do is let it know that you\u2019re still alive. Your best chance is to just let your body go limp and hope that it lets you go. If it doesn\u2019t, then you\u2019re pretty much screwed over. Although if it does let go of you, do not move.

It is estimated that all the gold in the world, so far refined, could be placed in a single cube 60 ft. on a side. It is metallic, with a yellow colour when in a mass, but when finely divided it may be black, ruby, or purple. It is the most malleable and ductile metal; 1 ounce (28 g) of gold can be beaten out to 300 square feet. It is a soft metal and is usually alloyed to give it more strength. It is a good conductor of heat and electricity, and is unaffected by air and most reagents.The most common gold compounds are auric chloride (AuCl3) and chlorauric acid (HAuCl4). A mixture of one part nitric acid with three of hydrochloric acid is called aqua regia (because it dissolved gold, the King of Metals). It is unaffected by air and most reagents. It is found free in nature and associated with quartz, pyrite and other minerals. Two thirds of the world's supply comes from South Africa, and 2/3 of USA production is from South Dakota and Nevada. Gold is found in sea water, but no effective economic process has been designed (yet) to extract it from this source.It would not normally be necessary to make gold in the laboratory as it is readily available commercially. The most romantic way to extract gold is by panning it out from a stream in some pleasant valley but most such sources are now depleted. Panning relies upon the density of gold (which is very high) being much greater than that of the sand and other particulates. It therefore settles to the bottom of the pan. Today, more often than not, gold is extracted from ores. These ores often contain relatively little gold. Some of these processes cause environmental concern. The ore is crushed to a powder so as to expose the small gold particles. These are dissolved by treatment of the rock with cyanide solution in air. The result of this is a gold cyanide complex. Addition of zinc powder to the resulting solution precipitates out the gold.4Au + 8NaCN + O2 + 2H2O  4NaAu(CN)2 + 4NaOH2NaAu(CN)2 + Zn  2NaCN + Zn(CN)2 + Au (s)", "example" : "Pirate's Treasure.", "word" : "gold"},{"definition" : "a better way to say darnet/danget. it\u2019s well used when you mess up, or make a mistake.", "example" : "awe man i sent the wrong tiktok to someone. goldang ;(.", "word" : "goldang"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "goldanged"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "goldarn"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "goldarned"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "goldarnedest"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "goldarns"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "goldbeater"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "goldbeating"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "goldbird"},{"definition" : "1. to avoid doing what you are supposed to be doing2. a person who avoids doing what they are supposed to be doing", "example" : "Why are you always goldbricking?
