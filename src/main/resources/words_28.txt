Many drugs, such as cough syrup and some antidepressants, cause temporary retention. Recreational drugs such as ecstasy, morphine, codeine and heroin and methadone may close down the bladder, sometimes for 24 hours. Surgery near the bladder area may upset the local nerves and may lead to retention of urine for 24 to 48 hours or more.", "example" : "One of my friends took a lot of ecstasy at at a party.

It is a distant cousin of the more familiar \"cue ball\" and \"chrome dome\". The ringhead takes the form of a line of hair perpetuating around the back of the head and terminating above the ears, while the rest of the head is either bald or only thinly covered in hair. You could think of the ringhead as a sort of massive bald spot to better understand the phenomenon. Rather than a preferred style, the ringhead is usually an attempt to keep the remaining hair one has and thus serves a defensive purpose against baldness. The ringhead has a few subtypes that are worth exploring:1. The Standard Ringhead-This is the most common form of ringhead. The standard ringhead is also very common among doctors, lawyers, professors and scientists, the theory being that because these occupations are held predominately by middle-aged men, there is an increased incidence of ringhead. In these cases, it's not uncommon to see the ringhead worn in conjunction with spectacles. This variation of the SR is dubbed the \"intellectual\" ringhead, or, in other cases the \"professional\" ringhead, as the glasses and  partial baldness project an aura of competence and experience (some people refer to it as the castanza as well, in reference to the seinfeld character).Examples of the Standard Ringhead include: George Castanza, Dr. Phil, Dick Cheney, Danny Devito, Dr. Katz, Homer Simpson and Mr. Spacely from the Jetsons.2. The Curtainhead-Also called the \"haircape\" the Curtainhead is a type of ringhead in which the ring is trimmed so infrequently that it grows long and forms a curtain of hair around the back of the head. This dew is sported frequently by homeless people (as they cannot afford haircut) and aging hippies. It is not worn by many others. This is understandable, since this hairstyle does not look very appealing and projects a sense of \"trashyness\". It is believed that some who wear this style are insecure about their hair loss, and so are compensating by growing their peripheral hair out very long. Examples of the Curtainhead include: Lots of bums and hippies, and Jay Sherman from \"The Critic\".3. The Combover Ringhead-A standard ringhead with a combover. Very tacky. Reflects insincerity as the person is trying to fool you into thinking they have hair and are younger than they are. Worn by dishonest people, such as used-car and bible salesmen, people on infomercials, and by people who don't want to accept the reality that they are getting old.Examples of the Combover Ringhead include: Woody Harrelson and Bill Murray in \"Kingpin\".

Satanists do not believe in a higher god, and are ordinary people. They do not dress in black, and try to sacrifice living animals for 'rituals.' These are the Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth as stated by the Church of Satan's founder, Anton Szander LaVey:1. Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked. 2. Do not tell your troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them. 3. When in another\u2019s lair, show him respect or else do not go there. 4. If a guest in your lair annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy. 5. Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal. 6. Do not take that which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and he cries out to be relieved. 7. Acknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained. 8. Do not complain about anything to which you need not subject yourself. 9. Do not harm little children. 10. Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for your food. 11. When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone bothers you, ask him to stop. If he does not stop, destroy him.Nine Satanic Statements. Those are:1.Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence.2.Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams.3.Satan represents undefiled wisdom instead of hypocritical self-deceit.4.Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates.5.Satan represents vengeance instead of turning the other cheek.6.Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires.7.Satan represents man as just another animal -- sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all-fours -- who, because of his \"divine spiritual and intellectual development,\" has become the most vicious animal of all.8.Satan represents all of the so-called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification.9.Satan has been the best friend the Church has ever had, as He has kept it in business all these years.Goths are not always satanists, but can be.Satanism is not related to christian.

The victim's head, hands, and feet would protrude from this improvised container.The victim would be forced to ingest milk and honey to the point of developing severe diarrhea, and more honey would be rubbed on his body so as to attract insects to the exposed appendages. He would then be left to float on a stagnant pond (or alternately, simply exposed to the sun somewhere). The diarrhoea would accumulate within the container, attracting more insects, which would eat and breed within the defenseless victim's exposed (and increasingly gangrenous) flesh. Death, when it eventually occurred, would probably be due to a combination of dehydration, starvation and septic shock. In other recorded versions, the insects did not eat the victim; biting and stinging insects such as wasps, which were attracted by honey on the body, acted as the torture.Death by scaphism is painful, humiliating, and protracted.
