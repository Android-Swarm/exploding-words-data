Fill the cups with any beer you want, preferablly filling the cups at least half full. also have two water cups to wash off dirty ping pong balls.

In the poem, Beowulf, a hero of a Germanic tribe from southern Sweden called the Geats, travels to Denmark to help defeat a monster named Grendel. This poem, about Danish and Swedish kings and heroes, was preserved in England because the English people are descendants of Germanic tribes called the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. Jutes and northern Saxon tribes came from what is now southern Denmark and northern Germany. Thus, Beowulf tells a story about the old days in their homeland.The poem is a work of fiction, but it mentions a historic event, the raid by king Hygelac into Frisia, ca 516. Several of the personalities of Beowulf (e.g., Hrothgar, Hrothulf and Ohthere), clans (e.g. Scyldings, Scylfings and Wulfings) and some of the events (e.g. the Battle on the Ice) also appear in early Scandinavian sources, such as the Prose Edda, Gesta Danorum, the legendary sagas, etc. In these sources, especially the Hrólf Kraki tales deal with the same set of people in Denmark and Sweden (see Origins for Beowulf and Hrólf Kraki).Consequently, many people and events depicted in the epic were probably real, dating from between 450 and 600 in Denmark and southern Sweden (Geats and Swedes). As far as Sweden is concerned, this dating has been confirmed by archaeological excavations of the barrows indicated by Snorri Sturluson and by Swedish tradition as the graves of Eadgils and Ohthere in Uppland. Like the Finnsburg Fragment and several shorter surviving poems, Beowulf has consequently been used as a source of information about Scandinavian personalities such as Eadgils and Hygelac, and about continental Germanic personalities such as Offa, king of the continental Angles.", "example" : "Beowulf was the greatest hero who ever lived!", "word" : "beowulf"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepaid"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepaint"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepainted"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepainting"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepaints"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepale"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepaper"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "beparch"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "beparody"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "beparse"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepart"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepaste"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepastured"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepat"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepatched"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepaw"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepearl"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepelt"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepen"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepepper"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "beperiwigged"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepester"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepewed"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bephilter"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bephrase"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepicture"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepiece"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepierce"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepile"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepill"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepillared"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepimple"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepimpled"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepimples"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepimpling"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepinch"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepistoled"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepity"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "beplague"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "beplaided"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "beplaster"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "beplumed"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepommel"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepowder"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepray"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepraise"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepraisement"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepraiser"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "beprank"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepranked"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepreach"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepress"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepretty"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepride"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "beprose"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepuddle"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepuff"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepuffed"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepun"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepurple"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepuzzle"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bepuzzlement"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "bequalm"},{"definition" : "1.

The Tuareg Berbers are nomads and do not recognise any borders so they live in constant movement between the southern edges of the Sahara and the northern ones.   Berber language is linguistically difficult to classify but linguists have found that the remotely closest relative to it is the ancient Egyptian and the Coptic ( only used in the Coptic church liturgy).   Although throughout history Berber personalities have significantly contributed to the human heritage ( saint Augustine the father of catholic theology; Ibn khaldun the father of  sociology; Hannibal the man who scared Rome -not Lecter-; many roman emperors; the Pharaoh Shoshenq the first; And for those who don\u2019t knew it Zinedine Zidane is a Berber too !\u2026) their contribution is either not recognized or their real identity mistaken with the predominant culture they live in (e.g. S. Augustine considered a roman, Hannibal a Carthaginian, Zinedine Zidane a French...   Their \u201cobscure\u201d origins come from the fact that their culture emerged in continuity from their prehistoric background in the region called Capsian  Neolithic culture, witch disconfirm  theories of middle-eastern origins.  Berbers belonged and will always belong to this land.    Its also noteworthy to mention that the resistance and continuity of  Berber is unique: since prehistoric times through early antiquity to modern days Berber hadn\u2019t change and is still spoken despite the fact that the region was invaded by loads of exogenous populations ( Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Vandals, Arabs, French, Spanish). It\u2019s a rare phenomenon and few languages achieved this constancy.   Berber also contributed to modern popular culture: for the fans of the Star Wars epopee, you all know about Tatooine the home planet of the Skywalker family. Well, this word come from the Berber plural word Titawine (titawin) witch means the eyes, as the tatooine planet got twin suns Tattoo I and Tatoo II  .the singular  word for an eye being Tit. And this comes from the fact that most of the scenes of this planet were shot in a Berber village in southern Tunisia.

The most well-known and common member of the betta family group is the betta splendens.  Other species of betta are harder to find and maintain than the common splendens.Betta are an easily kept aquarium fish, and average at 2 and 1/2 to 3 inches in body length (tail fin length varies, with some specimens reaching 4 inches in total length). Males are the most common specimens found in pet stores, and are brightly colored with long fins.  Females, once nearly impossible to find by non-breeders, have been trickling into pet stores for sale, though at first glance female bettas may be mistaken for a completely different species of fish. Females are the same size as male betta, often lack the same bright colors and never have the large amount of finnage that males have.Bettas do not require airation in their tanks. The fish posses a \"labyrinth organ\" inside of their heads which allows them to breathe air. It is an adaptation to their original habitat, in Thailand, where natural-form betta live in the stagnant, muddy, warm (usually over 80 degrees) water of rice paddies and ditches.  Bettas are predatory fish, and must be kept on a high protein diet in order to survive.  Special betta food is needed for them to live, but to thrive they *need* to be fed on live foods, such as mosquito larvae, bloodworms, small fruit flies, and fruit fly maggots.Males of this species are naturally competitive and agressive towards one another.  The fish are often fought for money in Siam and Vietnam, in tents set up for the purposes, rather like aquatic cockfighting.Betta have an average lifespan of 2 years (24 months).

The bin must be placed at a certain angle so that when the door is opened the bin will fall and create a startling noise and a characteristic *bang*, the decibal output of which depends on the material the bin is constructed of. This technique of 'Binning' was invented and developed by the now legendary UK STEALTH BINNING CORP®. The idea behind the prank is that whoever falls victim to a 'Binning' cannot punish those involved as they will have dispersed to an appropriate rendezvous point thus being able to deny any involvement in the binning incident. Different binning techniques show different levels of respect. A tall metal bin is the most lethal as this disperses the most rubbish and creates the most startling noise. A plastic bin with a bin bag should not disperse much rubbish therefore being less problomatic for the victim (a sign that you respect the victim more than the victim of a metal binning). Other materials have not yet been field tested but are currently under development. These include the Mk2 Metal Bin Stack and the Wooden Laundry Bin but information on these techniques will not be released until they have been adequatly tested. The art of binning was created as a action of jest which entailed a bin being placed against a toilet cubical door so after \"unleashing their load\" would have a bin fall down, but the art was soon lost and never used again. It was later rediscovered a month later and was deployed as a method of punishment to reap revenge on Mr Boyce (A skanky, sweaty, bearded, fat cunt). The most dangerous binning that ever transpired was a 'wheely bin' of which was set on fire and then placed against the door of somebodies place of residence in the middle of the night.    That, ladies and gentleman, boys and girls is the art or binning. Thanks for reading.", "example" : "Imagine...Your a teacher in your class. Your alone finishing some paperwork.

As you get to the door your sixth sense kicks in and you know somethings wrong. If it was a teacher they would've walked straight in after knocking. So you figure it must be a student.

It's the 2nd largest city in ND, (with Fargo being #1), but it has the provincial mindset of a town a tenth of its size.Bismarck (also known either as the \"Bizzo\", \"Bis-bang\" or  \"Bisquick\") is a quite boring, convervative-minded, extremely philistine, & white-bread town where people aged 18-35 are conspicuously absent, mainly because they have all moved away to other more intellectually & culturally superior cities (mainly to go to school there), namely Fargo, Minneapolis, Seattle, Chicago, etc.  The majority of the population that live in Bismarck are all either soccer-mom-type families and the middle-aged to elderly, making for less than a \"hip\" city (for want of a better term).  Bismarck is a depressing, bland shithole, however, it is quite a clean, quiet, and near crime-free city, but that's it.  There are no clubs or decent music venues, no decent art museums, no Thai restaurants, no bohemian/intellectual aspects at all, just the same old tired soccer-mom & blue-collar-barfly-catering interests, (however, the \"Urban Harvest\" festival held downtown every summer is somewhat of a refreshing exception to this).  The only form of recreation around here is either getting drunk, or driving up and down Main St. downtown continuously, ad nauseaum, wasting gasoline.Also, the music scene here is quite disappointing, its mainly middle-aged (once again) bar-playing cover bands doing covers of 70s \"classic rock\" tunes, and white blues players, although there are a few exceptions.  However, the music scene here 10 years ago (around 97-98) was quite impressive (even giving Fargo or Minot's scenes a run for their respective monies), with quite a few punk/metal/indie/electronic groups.  But alas, this was soon to come to an end with all the people involved in these bands moving far away from here later on :(.Bismarck is a great place to live, if you want to be bored to insanity, or to be deprived of anything of cultural/intellectual significance.  What can I say, Bismarck is quite a middle-aged city if there ever was one.

We might translate it by \"Can I help you?\".4.You would also say \"bitte\" when handing things over to somebody. In this context it would mean \"Here you are\". You would expect the person to whom you were handing over the object to respond by saying \"danke\" (see below).5. \"Bitte\" is also used as a response to \"danke\", which is the German equivalent of \"thanks\" or \"thank you\". \"Bitte\" then means \"You're welcome!\" or \"Don't mention it!\". This acknowledgement of thanks is not simply a matter of politeness - it can be impolite not to follow a \"danke\" with a \"bitte\", since to a German speaker you may appear to be refusing their thanks.\"Danke\" is often followed by either \"schön\" or \"sehr\".

Which, by the old ways would involve:  Heating an iron rod to cherry red in a forge, and hammering into whatever shape you wish your sword to be.  Iron is lighter than steel, but doesn't hold an edge as long.  So, many times, the bladesmith would turn the blade on edge, and with a hammer and chisel, would split the edge of the blade in for a half inche or so, and insert an edge of steel.  They would then re-heat the item, and hammer the iron down onto the inserted steel, fusing them together.  They would then temper the blade by heating the entire piece to cherry-red, and then submerging it in water, or oil.  This would harden the blade.  However, if left like this the sword would be to hard and brittle to use, and would break opon the first blow.  So they would then re-heat the blade to a deep red, and stick it in dry ashes to cool slowly.  This would partly anealIn this way, they would aneal, or soften the metal, while not entirely removing the temper.  The would then be hard enough to use in battle, but soft enough, and springy enough, that in wouldn't shatter on impact.  They would then polish and sharpen the blade.  In this way the smiths would create a sword with a steel edge, but that wieghed much less than a sword of only steel.The modern way is to:  Use a high-speed grinder to grind a bar of steel down into the shape of the blade you wish to make, then switch to a finer grinding wheel, and finally a buffing wheel to polish.  With a whet stone, you can then put an edge on it.  The modern method isn't nearly as good as the old methods, though.  Sword created by this method are really only good as display models.  It's a shame that so many of the ancient ways have been lost.  In this era, you could spend your whole life studying the art of bladesmithing, and never even come close to the skill level of an apprintice.  The blades of old could cut through solid stone without scratching the metal.  Many of them had edges that where only a few atoms in width, but were strong enough to slice through armor like paper.  With the finest, you could hold the sword out in front of you, and a silk cloth dropped on it would be cut cleanly in two, of its own wieght.  Smiths were held in the highest regard in the middle ages, placed in the same ranks as the priests and poets.  The smith was the only craftsmen to work with all four of the basic elements (for they belived in only four at that time).  He used fire in his forge, air in his bellows, to blow the fire hotter, water to quinch the metal, and earth, the iron he used.  (iron was known as the \"black metal,\" the metal of the earth.)     There are still many people who blacksmith and bladesmith as a hobby.  (I, am of course, one of them.)  It really is a wonderful hobby to take up.  Anybody can do it, it just takes a lot of work.  (I'm only 15.)     It's a very rewarding and interesting thing to do!  Ask around, there's probably a forge near you, that you could use.

Blight can worsten or recover, but if aided by a poor economy, it can be the precursor to the descent of the neighborhood into ghetto status.

While the males tend to be very friendly and congregate with other males, the females spend most of their time in supermarkets and shopping malls, using a shrill high-pitched call to discipline their children and contact other females. Males and females rarely interact socially except during breeding season, which is otherwise known as Friday night. During this time, females are allowed to enter the male-dominated area known as \"the pub\" and display their impressive coloured plumage to a prospective mate.Herein lies an intersting phenomenon.

Bouldering problems rarely go higher than 3 or 4 meters above the ground. \"Solving\" a problems often forces to make unlikely movements, like \"pinching\" a hold with your heels, or literally jumping from hold to hold (doing a \"dyno\"). Style is important, but what really counts is to reach the last hold (the \"top\")Bouldering was developed in the 60's in France and in California (by John Gill, the \"human fly\") as a pastime for bored rock climbers in off-season. In the 90's, however, the growth of indoor climbing walls (often homemade) and rock climbing gyms has made bouldering popular with the urban / hip-hop crowd, transforming it - in France and UK - in a \"signature\" sport like skateboarding. Part of the popularity of bouldering is due to  the fact that it's being quite cheap - the only thing you need is a pair of climbing shoes (and the crashpad if you're bouldering outdoor).There's a lively competition circuit around the world, and there are now bouldering sites (often simple concrete walls) almost in every city of the world.

Bradford is the seventh biggest city in the country, has won awards for being the cleanest in the country, is one of the few remaining places that you can smile at somebody and they will smile back, and the city's Lister Park has recently been awarded the Best Park in the UK Award after a recent renovation.Spontanious conversations occur with the people you least expect, people are genuine, care about how you are and are without doubt some of the most helpful around.Whilst not renowned for its nightlife, Bradford doesn't fair too badly, with the Rock, Indie and Alternative scene firmly established at venues around the city including Bradford Rio, the Gasworks, the Market Tavern, Exchange Bar and Delius, all of which are amazing, excusing the sticky floor. Mainstream pubs, clubs and restaurants also enjoy a presence in the city.Bradford City Centre is home to one of the finest collections of Victorian Architecture in the country, with the City Hall being the most obvious and glamorous example. However, to avoid the crowds (there's a Wetherspoon's over the road, head to the Wool Exchange, St George's Hall or Little Germany for some equally impressive buildings. Other (non Victorian) buildings include the 1930s classically styled Alhambra Theatre, the Edwardian Cathedral and a plethora of more modern and up-to-date buildings, to shortly include a brand new shopping and office development in the Broadway area of the city centre.Bradford is home to Britain's most-visited museum outside London, the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Britain's only Colour Museum, a fantastic Industrial Museum and an art gallery at Cartwright Hall, to name but a few interesting days out.There is very little crime in Bradford compared with the rest of the country (check out upmystreet.com if you don't believe me) and its major problem lies with the lack of civic pride from its citizens, which even people from such places as Liverpool and Middlesbrough manage to muster.

Essentially, all the cosmos stems from the vibration of the sound 'Aum' in Hindu cosmology. Indeed, so sacred is it that it is prefixed and suffixed to all Hindu mantras and incantations. It is undoubtedly the most representative symbol of Hinduism.According to Hindu philosophy this syllable is combined of three components: the letter A, which represents creation, when all existence issued forth from Brahma's golden nucleus; the letter U, which refers to Vishnu the god of the middle who preserves this world by balancing Brahma on a lotus above himself. The letter U with the A, produces the sound of the long &#332;. The M produces the prolonged resonance of the nasal cavity with the mouth closed: it is the final part of the cycle of existence, when Vishnu falls asleep and Brahma has to breathe in so that all existing things have to disintegrate and are reduced to their essence to him.
