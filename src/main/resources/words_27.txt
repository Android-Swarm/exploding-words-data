Somebody like 50 Cent or Cassidy has nothing on somebody like Mos Def.Most people say that rap degrades women. I don't really think so, because people need to realize..A bitch is a bitch.A hoe is a hoe.A whore is a whore.And a lady is a lady.Rap has something called a beat to it, something that sounds catchy and something you can dance to.For instance Tupac's California Love is something you can dance to. And anybody that tries to say thats not a good song...well isnt there a rock song that goes \"I've got 2 tickets to paradise, pack your bags we'll leave tonight.\"Some people say rap is senseless and doesnt talk about anything.Wake up people thats what music is.The ability to say express yourself, and it just so happens rap expresses itself more than others.And anybody who doesn't like rap, thats fine, but dont talk shit about it when you don't even know about it.", "example" : "I've said enough above...", "word" : "rap"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "rapaces"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "rapaceus"},{"definition" : "nub nubbins nubby noob", "example" : "Thine Rapacious is a nub", "word" : "rapacious"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "rapaciously"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "rapaciousness"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "rapacity"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "rapacities"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "rapakivi"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "rapallo"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "rapanea"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "rapateaceae"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "rapateaceous"},{"definition" : "to defeat soundly, destroy", "example" : "Kid i just got fuckin RAPED by that math test.

Contrary to popular belief, there are many different types of ravers. First there are Candy Ravers; these are the ones you see running around shouting things like \"PLUR!\" or \"Want a hug/sucker/glowstick/massage?\" They are identifiable by their brightly colored clothing (phat pants being a must...if they're made of fun fur, all the better), enough Candy (brightly colored bead bracelets)to sink the Titanic, oodles of children's toys, as well as a few glowsticks and pacifiers. Candy kids are known as the cutest/most annoying people you will ever meet. A lot of them are pretty fake - it's impossible to be that happy all the time. Candy Kids are also notorious for being users of the drug Ecstasy - this is not entirely accurate, but with the way they dress and act, its not hard to see why this is assumed.Next we have the \"Goth\" ravers. They're quite easy to spot - they will be dressed in all black, preferably incorperating some fishnet, spikes, and buckles into their outfits. The more there are the better. They will not socialize outside of the group they came with, and they will NEVER under any circumstances dance. They're too goth for that - dancing equates to happiness and celebration, and that's just not cool.Ginos and Ginas (also known as \"hoochies\"). These are those well-dressed, snooty people that really shouldn't even be at a rave. The only reason they're at the party is to pick up on some 15 year old e-tard. Well, maybe not, but they certainly are only at the party to get a piece of ass. They will be dressed in whatever is \"trendy\" and do not know how to dance.Next are junglists. Junglists are often viewed as being \"agro\". They listen primarily to Jungle/DnB music, and are partial to camo, hoodies, and clothing in dark colors. Popular junglist hairstyles are dreads (m+f), short hair (m+f), or short with two long bits in the front (f). Quite a few junglists are ex-candy ravers. They may also be \"old-skool\" or \"jaded\".Old-skool and jaded pretty much fall into the same category. Old-skoolers are ravers who have been in the scene since \"way back in the day\". No matter how good the party is, the music/DJs/parties/drugs/people/anything else about the scene was WAY better when they first started raving. A jaded raver is not nessicarily old skool, but shares the same views as the old skooler.And even still there are many ravers that do not fall into any of these categories. So...perhaps a raver is simply one who goes to parties to dance the night away, and loves the music. Interesting concept, hey? And we all thought it was about the drugs. *sarcasm*", "example" : "Rave is no longer a dirty 4-letter word.

It is used to boost signal levels and extend the distance a signal can be transmitted.  In radio terms, the signal is usally recieved on a input frequency and then retransmitted on a different frequency (output or direct).2) A network device that repeats signals from one cable onto one or more other cables, while restoring signal timing and waveforms. Repeaters are the most common way to connect local networks together, and can provide either Thinwire or Thickwire connections. They are commonly used to create larger local networks up to a certain limit based on the number of repeaters and the length of the cables. 3) A device inserted at intervals along a circuit to boost, and amplify an analog signal being transmitted. A repeater is sometimes needed because the quality and strength of a signal decays over distance. Repeaters are also used to regenerate a digital signal - \"squaring it\" and \"cleaning it up\" - but not changing it. You can regenerate digital signals because technology exists that can separate the actual signal from the noise, regenerating only the signal. No technology exists that can do this with analog signals. The simplest type of LAN interconnection device is a repeater. A repeater moves all received packets or frames between LAN segments. The primary function of a repeater is to extend the length of the network media, i.e. the cable. 4) someone who is repeatedly arrested for criminal behavior 5) a firearm that can fire several rounds without reloading", "example" : "The Fairfax County Public Schools use digital trunked repeaters that operate in the 800 MHz range for thier school buses.The criminal (in your case) used a repeater to kill the police officer.", "word" : "repeater"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repeaters"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repeating"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repeats"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repechage"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repeddle"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repeddled"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repeddling"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repeg"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repel"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repellance"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repellant"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repellantly"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repelled"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repellence"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "repellency"},{"definition" : "One of your friends in a group who tends to scare away girls most of the time because he's an idiot around them.
