During a time when racism had made its way through Christian denominations and split the faith by skin color, people of all different ethnicities became entangled in love with the birth of the Pentecostal Movement.Particularly different from other denominations, Pentecostals believe that miracles, signs, and \"gifts of the Spirit\" are still operational in modern society. The gift that occurs most frequently in Pentecostal churches is glossalalia, also known as \"speaking in tongues.\" Most often manifests itself, not in speaking other human languages, but in speaking in the tongues of angels (1 Corinthians 14:2, 1 Corinthians 13).Pentecostalism is the fastest growing Christian denomination in the world by conversion and arguably makes Christianity the fastest growing religion. (Islam is the fastest growing religion by birth, but Christianity is the fastest growing by converts.)There are many different groups within Pentecostalism itself: some which believe in the Trinity, others which deny it and believe in the Oneness of God; some which baptize solely in Jesus' Name (Acts 2:38), and others which baptize in \"the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost\"; some with very strong standards for women (i.e., not cutting their hair or wearing pants), and others with only standards of modesty.It should be noted that the Charismatic Movement was birth out of the Pentecostal Movement. While all Charismatics are (consequently) Pentecostals, all Pentecostals are not Charismatics. Popular televangelists like Kenneth Copeland, Benny Hinn, and Creflo Dollar are Charismatics who are teachers in the \"Word of Faith Movement.\" They are not classical Pentecostals.", "example" : "The Assemblies of God, The Church of God in Christ, the United Pentecostal Church International, The Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, The First Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ, are among many organizations that are classified as Pentecostal.", "word" : "pentecostal"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentecostalism"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentecostalist"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentecostals"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentecostarion"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentecoster"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentecostys"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentelic"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentelican"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentene"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "penteteric"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "penthemimer"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "penthemimeral"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "penthemimeris"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "penthestes"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "penthiophen"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "penthiophene"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "penthoraceae"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "penthorum"},{"definition" : "1) A top shelf magazine.2) The highest suite of a residential building, which is also the best-catered and most expensive by far.3) the best availiable", "example" : "I jack off to penthouse sitting in my penthouse appartment and it feels like penthouse.

Cyrus set out to create a powerful empire. in fact, he created THE FIRST EMPIRE. the word \"Persia\" comes from the greek word \"persis\" which means empire. the relative strength of the persian empire at the height of its power was like the relative strength of modern day, china, india, russia, EU, US and japan put together. the persians were the first people in history to give men and women equal rights, abolish slavery and write the very first human and animal bill of rights. they also built in 400s BC the very first stadium, the apadana in persepolis (later burnt down by alexander). the apadana was able to seat 15 (yes, fifteen thousand) people in it, with space left for a grand ceremony. this massive bulding was roofed. unlike the collosium. the arcitectural and worth of this single building, if it lived through the fire alexander put it through, would have dwarfed the city of rome.The persian empire was a god compared to rome. when rome attacked persia (battle of carhae) with 44 thousand soldiers, a 10 thousand man army from the persian empire crushed the romans, and sent tehir general's head back to rome.people commonly mistake persians for arabs, this is a fatal mistake, persians are aryans like the germans. they migrated from southern russia. NEVER CALL A PERSIAN AN ARAB! THEY WILL SNAP, THEY MIGHT DO SOMETHING DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH AND/OR REPUTATION!the persian empire at the height of its power ruled from eastern india, to southern russia, to egypt, to thrace and the persian gulf. they ruled over 80% of the civilized world.the end of persian supremacy:after the arab invasion of persia, their culture was weakened by islam. the islamic hordes burnt all books in the persia libraries, destroying the knowledge that took europe 1000 years to re-invent. even after the arab invasion, persia still held a powerful seat in international sayings. Nader (Na-dde-r) shah of persia, restored the persian glory around the 1600s.modern persia:until 1935, persia was the actuall name, after than, reza shah changed that to \"iran\" which was the original name the mades and other aryan tribes gave it. the word \"iran\" literally means \"land of the aryans\". in 1953, a coup organized by the CIA to bring down iran's first democrtically elected official (mossadeq) because he nationalized the oil industry. they then installed the dictatoric mohamad reza shah, who was a puppet of the americans. he was overthrown in 1979 after the islamic revolution. which produced a more democratic government compared to the Shah's, but not quite democratic enough. in 1980, iraq invaded iran. possibly a work of the CIA, or the americans, in payback for the iranian's hostage crisis (that was nothing compared to what the US did later to iran). iran fought iraq bravely for 8 years, contributed some 1 million casualties, and pushed iraq back. at this time, iran had no weapons program. iraq was aided by the west with sattelite pictures, and chemical and biological weapons, which they launched into iranian cities. after the war was over, at around 1995, iran started to produce its own fighter jet, and tank. they recently developed their medium range missile. they are now working on their controversial nuclear energy program, which the US labels as a plot to develop nuclear weapons.Conclusion:the persian empire was the longest lasting power on earth. it lasted for about 1500 years as a world power. 1200 of those, it was THE world power. if it were up to me, the only nation truely deserving of being called an empire was the persian empire. iran is doing much better than all other islamic countries at the moment. it holds 17% of all of the world's resources. it has what it takes to become an empire again, but unfortunatly, the current world power, and the current government make that impossible. you generally dont learn about the persian empire in schools in the US, canada, mexico, and most of europe, simply because of politics. to give you an image of what they are not teaching you, consider this: you were never taught about rome, wwi, wwii, the cold war and the american colonies. all those put together come close to the magnitude of the importance of the persian empire in shaping the world as we see it today.",

So you must obey them and do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.  They tie up heavy loads and put them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.\u201cEverything they do is done for men to see: They make their phylacteriesa wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them \u2018Rabbi.\u2019\u201cBut you are not to be called \u2018Rabbi,\u2019 for you have only one Master and you are all brothers.  And do not call anyone on earth \u2018father,\u2019 for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.  Nor are you to be called \u2018teacher,\u2019 for you have one Teacher, the Christ. The greatest among you will be your servant.  For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.\u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.\u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are.\u201cWoe to you, blind guides! You say, \u2018If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.\u2019  You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred?  You also say, \u2018If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound by his oath.\u2019  You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?  Therefore, he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.  And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.  And he who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it.\u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices\u2013mint, dill and cummin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law\u2013justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.\u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and selfindulgence.  Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.\u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.  In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\u201cWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.  And you say, \u2018If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.\u2019  So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of the sin of your forefathers!\u201cYou snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?  Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.  And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.

The sugars are made by photosynthesis, which occurs in green parts of plants, such as leaves (see leaf). The amino acids are made from sugars and minerals, such as nitrate absorbed from the soil. Phloem tissue is usually found close to the other transport tissue in plants, xylem, which transports water and minerals. In non-woody plants phloem and xylem are found in bundles, such as the veins of a leaf.Phloem is composed of sieve elements and their associated companion cells, together with some sclerenchyma and parenchyma cell types. Sieve elements are long, thin-walled cells joined end to end, forming sieve tubes; large pores in the end walls allow the continuous passage of nutrients. Phloem is usually found in association with xylem, the water-conducting tissue, but unlike the latter it is a living tissue.

It is true, though, that anger and stress affect hormone levels and thus bodily oil production, which can cause acne. People of all ages and races can get acne. It is most common in adolescents and some young adults. 85% of people between the ages of 12 and 24 develop acne. For most people, acne tends to go away around the time they reach their thirties; however, some people in their forties and fifties continue to have this skin problem.To see the effects of HORMONES on the skin, just look at a very large weightlifter/bodybuilder.  If they have a lot of pimples on their back or arms or shoulders or even some on their face and they are in their late 20s or 30s or older, the cause of this is NOT puberty; but excess Testosterone which is proof that acne is directly related to hormone balance or imbalance.  Women will sometimes get acne around the time of their menstrual cycle...a time of hormonal changes.  You will likely notice that young pubescent males get far worse acne than girls.
