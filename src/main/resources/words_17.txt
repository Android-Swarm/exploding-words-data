One of a religious order founded by Ignatius Loyola, and approved in 1540, under the title of The Society of Jesus.Note: The order consists of Scholastics, the Professed, the Spiritual Coadjutors, and the Temporal Coadjutors or Lay Brothers. The Jesuit novice after two years becomes a Scholastic, and takes his first vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience simply. Some years after, at the close of a second novitiate, he takes his second vows and is ranked among the Coadjutors or Professed. The Professed are bound by a fourth vow, from which only the pope can dispense, requiring them to go wherever the pope may send them for missionary duty. The Coadjutors teach in the schools, and are employed in general missionary labors. The Society is governed by a General who holds office for life.

It is a mark of disrespect to refer to a wrestler as a jobber, as it implies they are a failure in their career. The term has entered into popular culture, to mean a loser or someone who is worthless, as well as its Italian equivalent, jabroni, a phrase that was made popular by The Rock. Former alternate terms included journeyman (because of jobbers being hired for individual matches and not having contracts with the major promotions), enhancement talent (due to their usage to enhance the stature of their opponent) and ham-n-egger (in reference to the amount of money they make buys them just enough for a Ham and Egg breakfast).Despite the negative sense of the word, some wrestlers have made a career out of jobbing. Barry Horowitz and Steve Lombardi (better known as the \"Brooklyn Brawler\") made a career out of jobbing, primarily in the World Wrestling Entertainment.A slightly higher position is jobber to the stars, which is a wrestler who still defeats pure jobbers but who consistently loses to top-level or up-and-coming stars. This often happens to popular faces towards the end of their careers, including Tony Garea and Tito Santana. Triple H was given this role from 1996-1997 by Vince McMahon as punishment for the infamous MSG Incident.Many top names in wrestling began their careers as jobbers. Mick Foley and Bret Hart began their careers as jobbers in the 1980s, later going on to greater success in the 1990s after employers began to recognize their talent.

There are many different forms of Judaism, but there are 4 very big ones:The first type of jew is orthodox. These jews follow the book very strictly, such as keeping kosher, wearing kippas and lighting shabbat candles; although they still have room to wear normal clothes and appear as normal people.Second type: Hasidic. Hasidic jews are like orthodox jews who also wear nice clothes, a hat, and have peyes (The Curly Sideburns) usually when a jew is stereotyped in a movie this is how they appear, two famous hasidic jews are The Hebrew Hammer (fictional), and Matisyahu (a Hasidic Jew who raps in the Jamaican style).The third type is conservative: These jews follow many jewish rules, but do not always keep kosher and wear yarmulkes (another word for kippah). I used to be conservative, but my \"temple\" was snobby so we found a new one.The last type is reform: Reform jews are still jews who practice their religion (or at least I do) but have adjusted to the modern world, such as wearing normal clothes, not ALWAYS keeping kosher, and not lighting sabbath candles.

It is a milestone in firearms design, combining an incredibly robust, soldier-proof design with relatively light weight. The ergonomics, like many Soviet-era designs, are somewhat lacking. The rifle is chambered for an \"intermediate-power\" cartridge, the 7.62x39mm, which is comparable to the 19th-century .30-30 Winchester. In 1959, the design was modernized and upgraded and the name changed to AKM (Avtomat Kalashnikova Modernizirovannyj; Automatic rifle of Kalashnikov, modernized). This design and its various folding-stock versions was standard issue for all Warsaw Pact countries until 1974, when it was modified yet again to take a new (and arguably less effective) cartridge, the 5.45x39mm, and became the AK-74. All of these rifles are generically termed \"AKs\" or \"Kalashnikovs\".

Traditional rules are similar to that of baseball (an infinitely inferior game, even if it is more popular). The chief difference is that in kickball you kick a ball, instead of, slightly homoerotically, swing at balls with your (wood) bat. Kickball also involves the fielders attempting to get out the runners by tagging them, or (for those with skill) pegging them.

(Most liberal interpretation)Verb.1. To tuck up or gather into pleats, as in making a kilt.2. To wear or equip with a kilt.A kilt is a man's skirt and traditionally a masculine garment.  Despite this and because most types of skirts in western culture are worn by women, it causes great anxiety and insecurity amongst individuals of both genders including some men who wear kilts and some men who don't like kilts.Some men who don't wear kilts can bequite hostile towards, and question the masculinity of, male kilt wearers.  They credential their own manliness by trying to diminish the manhood of others.  They may also feel threatened by the self-confidence of a man who wears a kilt, and jealousy because of the appeal it has with some women who themselves don't find it threatening.  Though they are often very homophobic towards kilt wearers, they are ironically quite familiar with unusal and scatological sexual acts between men.Some men who do wear kilts try diligently to convince themselves and others that a kilt isn't a skirt.  Some kilted men feel injured and angered by others who refer to their kilts as skirts.

Kings were finding they owned more land than they could control, so they gave vast expanses of it to barons (dukes, counts, etc) in return the barons would pay taxes to the king and would fight for him when it was demanded of them, and they must provide an agreed number of men. Barons are like the medieval equivilant of generals.The barons continued to break up this land into smaller patches, which was controlled by a knight. The knight usually owned one or two villages in his land. The knight would tax the peasants in his land. In return for this, the knight must fight for their lord baron when called upon, and also pay taxes to him, exactly the same duties that the king expects from the barons.The knight could be viewed as the medieval equivilant of captains/minor officers today. They recruited both men-at-arms (peasants aspiring to be honourable warriors) and archers (peasants that played the less honourable role of using bows/crossbows to fight,) and took these men with them when the baron called them to fight.The knight is a trained killer. Taken from a family of high rank, the young knight (or \"page\") left home at about the age of 6 to live with another knight, or even a baron, in their manor or castle. For the first 4 or so years, they were taught manners, such as how to speak different languages or how to carve a roast. From the age of around 10, they were upgraded into \"squires:\" knights to be. Training as a squire was particulry difficult. By about the age of 18, the knight was a fully trained and honed killer, and was knighted by their master in a long knighting ceremony.Knights from around 1100AD onwards were expected to follow a code of chivalry, which meant being polite to everyone and being generous to the poor. Knights are sometimes dramatised; many knights ignored the code and were simply ruthless, greedy killers. Most base rules were followed however: it was considered cowardly to use a bow, and it was also very dishonourable (and also a waste of ransom money) to kill a defenceless or surrendering opponent.Contrary to popular belief, knights were NOT common soldiers in armour. Knights were men of rank, and it was rare to see huge armies of knights without a vast number of peasant infantry accompanying them. Sometimes the knights and men-at-arms would gather to lead the first wave, as it was their honour and right to do so, but as tactics became more and more important in medieval warfare this custom was less common.", "example" : "Sir Vircotti, the Milanese knight, left his quiet manor and village to join his lord in a crusade to re-capture the holy land.", "word" : "knight"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knightage"},{"definition" : "to get dunked on so hard that you land on your back", "example" : "DeAndre Jordan got the alley oop from CP3 and knighted that dude.", "word" : "knighted"},{"definition" : "A female knight that protects the honor of her Customer's Applications!", "example" : "Ellie, the knightess stood strong against the Linux Driver attack.", "word" : "knightess"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knighthead"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knighthood"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knighthoods"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knightia"},{"definition" : "the act or process of honoring a page or servant by placing the erect penis from ear to top of head to ear while the servant or page is in the subdued position of being on the knees", "example" : "\"Sire, I just finished knighting your chamber maid because she cleaned my chamber pot most spectacularly\"\"Oh to be Sir Galahad's Flesh Knightee!\" ", "word" : "knighting"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knightless"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knightly"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knightlihood"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knightlike"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knightliness"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knightling"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knights"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knightship"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knightswort"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "kniphofia"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knipperdolling"},{"definition" : "Potato pastry.", "example" : "Give me a dozen knishes - a baker's dozen, dammit!", "word" : "knish"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knishes"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knysna"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "knisteneaux"},{"definition" : "A girl who is hot where it matters.  i.e. between the KNees and tITs.

In the sexually degrading version, the chisel is a mans penis and rather than hacking into it he is wanking onto the female. The pivots on two ends are the \"traditional spitroast\".There are a few rules assosciated with a lathe:1. No crossing swords.2. When eye contact is made a high five must be given.3. Which dude will recieve the blowjob, which guy will fuck her doggy and which one(s) wank over top, must be prederteremined before the spitroast. This is to avoid the complicated situations when all males only wish to get oral from a less than average female, or when all wish to fuck a rare 'honey' that can be conned into a lathe. A typical lathe involves two males pivoting the female on the ends, with one wanking over top. However more males can chip in with the 'lathe' action by wanking over top as well.

When \"launching\" a car, one places the car in gear, revs the engine to high RPM, then drops the clutch in very rapidly (see dumping the clutch). The idea  behind a launch is to accelerate as quickly as possible from a standstill without experiencing wheelspin or loss of traction, in which one has to find the correct RPM (engine speed) to release the clutch in order to accelerate. This is different form just plain \"dumping the clutch\", where the revs are usually higher and the balance of traction is not as perfect. Launches are almost always done in a car with a manual transmission and clutch the driver can operate; however, some drivers with automatic transmissions choose to use a similar technique when accelerating from a standstill, where the brake pedal is applied, the engine is revved, and then released to launch the car forward. This technique often puts an excessive amount of stress on the car's drive train. On newer sports cars with formula one style sequential gearboxes and no clutch, the car's computer will often be programmed for acceleration from a standstill, usually initiated by a \"launch\" button or \"race mode\" the driver can push.
