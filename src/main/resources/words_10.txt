A Dollar is 90% pure silver (412.5 grains in weight) or 90% pure gold (25.8 grains). A DOLLAR of silver weighs the same as ten silver dimes, or four silver quarters, or two silver halves.THE TERM DOLLAR HAS BEEN DEFINED SEVERAL WAYS:\u201cA silver coin\u201d Webster\u2019s Encyclopedic Dictionary, 1980.\u201cA weight of gold or silver\u201d Encyclopedia Britannica, 1962.\u201c412.5 grains of silver\u201d World Dictionary, 1959.The Century Dictionary, Published 1914 (with over 8,000 pages of definitions) defines the term DOLLAR as \u201cThe monetary unit or standard of value of the United States and Canada. By the term Dollar in the United States is intended the coined dollar of the United States, a certain quantity in weight and fineness of gold or silver\u2026\u201dSilver Certificates state the following: \u201cThis certifies that there is on deposit in the Treasury of the United States of America (denomination) Dollar(s) in silver payable to the bearer on demand.\u201dUnited States Notes states the following: \u201cThe United States of America will pay to the bearer on demand (denomination) Dollar(s).\u201d A NOTE cannot be a DOLLAR, it can only be a promise to pay.Constitutional Requirement:The United States Constitution only permits coined money to be used to pay debts.Article 1, Section 10, paragraph 1, The United States Constitution:No State shall make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts\u2026.Coinage Act of April 2, 1792:The money of account of the United States shall expressed in dollars or units\u2026all accounts in public and all proceedings in the courts of the United States shall kept and had in conformity to this regulation.Paper receipts for gold and silver are no longer issued by the United States.Besides the denominations of United States notes, from $1 to $10,000, that were issued before 1929, several other types of United States paper receipts no longer issued have circulated within the past 75 years. National Bank notes were issued by national banks from 1863 to 1929. Gold certificates, authorized in 1865 and issued by the Treasury Department in exchange for gold coin and bullion, circulated until 1933. Silver certificates, authorized in 1878 and issued in exchange for dollars of silver, accounted for nearly all of the $1 notes in circulation until November 1963, when the first $1 Federal Reserve notes without the \u201cWill Pay To The Bearer On Demand\u201d notation were issued as money.Which one is the real Money? The Federal Reserve Note without the \u201cWill Pay To The Bearer On Demand\u201d removed was first issued in November 1963. It claims to be Five Dollars.A Note is a promise to pay. It cannot be money.The United States Note that was issued before November 1963 was redeemable for Five Dollars. If it was redeemable for Five Dollars, it could not be the Five Dollars. Real Money is for example a 1913 Dollar of Silver (412.5 grains of silver in weight)AKA the Morgan Dollar of Silver.The paper money we use every day are Federal Reserve Notes (FRN), not Dollars as we commonly call them. The FRNs are no longer receipts for \u201cDollars\u201d or \u201cDollars of Silver\u201d. If a FRN is not redeemable for \u201cDollars\u201d what is it worth? It is worth what you believe it is worth, since you can still use it to buy things, it has a value. But what is it costing you to use FRNs that are not backed by something tangible (like gold or silver) to control its worth? Since there is nothing controlling the actual number of FRNs printed, an unlimited amount can be produced. As in any market, the value of anything goes down if there is more of the item available to be consumed. There is a way to place a value on a FRN by comparing it to the value of a Dollar of Silver. As of Oct. 18, 2008 the NYMEX closing price of silver was at 9.32 FRNs per troy ounce of silver. Each Morgan Dollar contains 0.7735 troy ounces of silver. This translates to a value of 7.21 FRNs for each Morgan Dollar. Transversely, the value of a FRN is about 13.7 cents. This is why things cost so much. The FRNs we call Dollars only have the buying power of 13.7 cents.Today\u2019s FEDERAL RESERVE* (Private Corporation with Federal Controls) NOTES are not redeemable for silver or gold. They survive by our faith only.

The Dotard is usually bred in captivity by wealthy families that wish to pass on their inheritance without having to raise an actual human.

Although a Dotard has the ability to speak, they usually have a very limited vocabulary and are limited to simple words and sentences. The Dotard requires some food to survive, but the most important thing in raising a Dotard is to feed its ego. The Dotard has a very large ego that requires constant feeding. If the Dotard's ego isn't constantly fed, it will usually resort to social media, rallies, or other places where it can feed its ego in large quantities. Another main difference between a Dotard and a human is the digestive process. Whereas a human will defecate through the anus, a Dotard defecates through the mouth by spewing shit at anyone nearby. Due to its limited vocabulary and IQ, a Dotard is only able to perform limited tasks. Some examples of common tasks that a Dotard is able to perform include the following: politics, golfing, eating fast food and diet coke, spending daddy's money, and shutting down governments.

More likely, however, \"dunnish\" is a portmanteau word, combining the words \"done\" and \"punish,\" or possibly \"done\" and \"finish.\"", "example" : "1.

As young children, they go in open-hearted and free -- at night, they imagine that their tiny hands can reach up and touch the birds. The entire world is a new place and the fascination of beauty never subsides. But as older adolescents leaving their high school, they go close-minded and bondaged -- at night, they drink themselves into passing out and talk about the most popular thing to come, under obligation. The boys worry about their sexual conquests. The girls worry about their sexual appearance. Both worry about being social in a society that has made a weakness of kindness and an insult of emotion. Such a great change occurs between those who enter school and those who leave it.Just think of the sheer idiocy of compulsary education. We threaten these children with imprisonment if they do not appear in class. Once in class, they spend their time either sleeping or completing tasks that are completely irrelevant to them. By giving them no option in their schooling, what have we taught them? The first lesson they learn is to detest learning, to hold unbridled sympathy for education. Take any man, put him in chains, and force him to recite poetry, or force him to play an instrument, or force him to farm the land -- and once he becomes a free man, do you think he will want to engage in that activity that was forced upon him? The scars on a slaves hands from working the fields, the memories of abuse of a house servant; given the right to do as they wish in the world, is it likely to think that they will return to that work which they were forced to do? And then consider schools. We force children to sit and overfeed them erroneous facts, faulty logic, damaged reasoning, concealed under the guise of \"schooling.\" Once the mental faculties of these children are damaged, their heart grows an animosity towards learning, towards books, towards facts and knowledge. It is the greatest folly to make children hate learning, and the greatest danger to a real, living Democracy in any nation.Because when the Red Sox win a baseball game, five universities in the state of Massachussetts riot. But when the United States regime supports a South American dictator known for slaughtering his own people, it's a whisper lost in the wind.Our ignorance is their power.Real knowledge is acquired by learning what interests you, through reading, investigation, practice, or any other desirable method. To become intelligent, you must engage in activity with the idea that are you learning because you want to, because knowledge is a goal. The path to conformity varies greatly from this. First, you engage in nothing, but allow cultural standards and social obligations to control you. Second, the idea of learning is to memorize random, perhaps unrelated and blatant facts -- true or untrue -- so that they may be recited upon command. Third, the goal is not knowledge, but a passing grade; they learn to for the sake of knowledge, but rather for the sake of social acceptance.Take two children. Give the first freedom and liberty, give him a wealth of books and movies, give him teachers to aid him upon his request and a place that encourages art, creativity, and independence. Then take away the freedom and liberty of the second, require his presence in a classroom in front of a teacher, threaten him with a jail sentence if he does not go to his school. Give each of them ten or fifteen years, and check the development of each of them after this amount of time. The only forced to endure slavery may be able to stand in a lecture hall and he might be able to say to you, \"George Washington was born in 1732 and died in 1799. In 1776, the Revolutionary War began where he acted as general. In 1783, it ended. In 1789, he was elected president a first time, and in 1792, he was elected president a second time.\" You are given dates and events, surely, it is true history. But take the child who was given freedom to do as he pleased, and he might be able to stand in a lecture hall and tell you, \"In the sixteenth century, in Europe, a Spanish physician by the name of Michael Servetus was convicted of heresy by the Roman Catholic Church. Fleeing from his oppressors, he made it to Geneva, where the vindictive John Calvin had absolute authority. In earlier years, Servetus expressed his doubt on Calvin's protestant religion. Once captured by the authorities, Servetus was burned to death at the orders of John Calvin in 1533. They had him wear a hat of sulphur and used slow-burning wood, that the crowd could listen to screams for mercy for the duration of a half hour. One year after the death of this man, Calvin published a list of insults of his former enemy.\"Be a rebel. Because being a conformist means admitting that the parts of you that matter are already dead.But if that's the case, what does matter? The emotions that run rampant through our head, the thoughts that we tumble and toss over in our minds constantly -- sexual fantasies to memories of our friends and family, thoughts and ideas about our future, wishes and desires for our current life with those who are close to us. The idea of a living freedom, knowing that what you wish to do believe with your mind is unrestricted and what you wish to do with your body, so long as you harm none, is unlimited. Life matters to us because we make it matter; if we never told a lover we would miss them upon our departure for a long voyage, if we never told a family member that we dream of a time when oppression ended, if we never wrote a poem and hoped to give it to a friend whose face we haven't seen in years -- if we never cared about life, then life wouldn't matter. What matters is what we make matter. So in a few years, all the kids who graduate from high school will know that their grades never mattered, because even though so young, they already know that it won't be the grades they got that they think about upon their death bed.Twenty years ago the textbooks used in history class just began to cover some of the issues of the four hundred years of oppression of the African race in this country.Children who are forced into a school and forced to complete erroneous assignments learn only one thing: to hate education. I clearly demonstrated this truth earlier, but there is more to be learned from it. Take a slave. It could be a slave from any society, whether an African in colonial America or a Plebeian in the Roman Empire. For the entirety of their life, they labor. Their sweat, their tears, their blood, the biproducts of their toil seep into the ground and their garments. All they produce goes to the one who did not labor (and alas, our modern Capitalist system has managed to recreate these conditions). Inside every slave, there will be a growing hatred of their activity as a servant, a farmer, a manufacturer -- they will learn to hate what has been forced upon them without their consent. But inside some of them, there will be the kindling of hope for a dream. One day, they will hope to produce for themselves, knowing that what their hands reap will be what fills their stomach, and not the stomach belonging to idle hands. So, too, it is with our compulsary education. The more we are forced into schools and our minds filled with useless facts, the stronger our thirst grows for real education, for real knowledge. Few are like this, but we exist. Others simply remain politically and emotionally sedated, as the focus of their mind is the next test or the next prom, and not children enslaved in southeast asia or the meaning of life.To every student who must endure the excuse of an education system that we have, I can only offer these words of hope... Educate yourself, not with school teachers, but with the books they wanted to ban. Teach yourself, learn, grow, and develop. Learn that the greatest asset education can offer is that of independence.\"If the teacher happens to be a man of sense, it must be an unpleasant thing to him to be conscious, while he is lecturing his students, that he is either speaking or reading nonsense, or what is very little better than nonsense....\"The discipline of colleges and universities is in general contrived, not for the benefit of the students, but for the interest, or more properly speaking, for the ease of the masters. Its object is, in all cases, to maintain the authority of the master, and whether he neglects or performs his duty, to oblige the students in all cases to behave to him, as if he performed it with the greatest diligence and ability. It seems to presume perfect wisdom and virtue in the one order, and the greatest weakness and folly in the other.\"-- Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Book 5, Chapter I, Part 3, Article II.Life matters to us because we make it matter.

Electro was directly influenced by Kraftwerk and Funk, whereas earlier hip-hop was closer to disco. Defining characteristics of this genre were dominating synthesizer lines and rhythm sections comprised of drum machine beats, rather than samples. Vocals were delivered in a robotic, dead pan matter.As time progressed, many subgenres grew out of electro, as well as a certain fashion sense and attitude. Foremost among these were electroclash (a hybrid of electro, new wave, and Italo disco) and electropop (a form of synthpop characterized by a cold, robotic sound). It is heavily debated among music scholars whether or not these are actual subgenres of electro. Electro is considered synonymous to this day with these two genres.Electro also spawned more valid, genuine subgenres, including electro funk, electro bass, glitch electro, downtempo electro, and minimal electro. Electro also influenced freestyle music and Miami bass (in turn creating techno bass), and had a significant role in the evolution of ghettotech. When someone refers to electro in modern times it is not likely they are referring to the original hip-hop style. Electro is commonly used as shorthand for describing music from the electropop revival and electro house scene. Electro was extremely influential, inspiring a myriad of subgenres, all of which could be considered electro. This makes it very confusing when trying to ascertain exactly what strand of electro a certain artist's sound fits into. In general, many people use electro to describe all electronic music meant to be danced to, distinguishing it from electronica (electronic music meant for home listening).Electro is used most accurately to describe the original strand of funk influenced hip-hop.

Other sites for these endometrial growths may include the bladder, bowel, vagina, cervix, vulva, and in abdominal surgical scars. Less commonly they are found in the lung, arm, thigh, and other locations.This misplaced tissue develops into growths or lesions which respond to the menstrual cycle in the same way that the tissue of the uterine lining does: each month the tissue builds up, breaks down, and sheds. Menstrual blood flows from the uterus and out of the body through the vagina, but the blood and tissue shed from endometrial growths has no way of leaving the body. This results in internal bleeding, breakdown of the blood and tissue from the lesions, and inflammation -- and can cause pain, infertility, scar tissue formation, adhesions, and bowel problems.Diagnosis is considered uncertain until proven by laparoscopy, a minor surgical procedure done under anesthesia. A laparoscopy usually shows the location, size, and extent of the growths.
