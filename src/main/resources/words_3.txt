Although asexuality is a lack of sexual attraction, it does not imply lack of a sex drive, or libido.\n\nAsexuals may or may not experience romantic attraction and will often identify by one of the following romantic orientations:1. aromantic - lack of romantic attraction to either sex2. biromantic - romantic attraction to both sexes3. heteroromantic - romantic attraction to the opposite sex4. homoromantic - romantic attraction to the same sex\n\nAsexuals may engage in sexual activity for one or more of the following reasons:1. to satisfy one's own sex drive, or libido2. to satisfy a non-asexual partner's sexual desires3. to satisfy intellectual curiosity\n\nSome asexuals experience sexual attraction to a very finite extent. Gray area asexuals will rarely experience sexual attraction while demisexuals will only experience sexual attraction within a well-established relationship.\n\nThe asexual pride flag is comprised of four horizontal bars.

When most people referance Atlanta they mean to referance metro Atlanta which would include the suburbs. Only 400,000 people live within Atlanta city limits while 4 million people live in the suburbs. So, as you might expect, living in the burbs is not a status symbol in Atlanta because just about everyone does. Atlanta is the capital of the south as the cultural, business, and spiritual center hub. Here is a breakdown of Atlanta and her suburbs:ATLANTA:Buckhead(Uptown): This is the wealthiest community of the metro area. Most of the people that hail from Buckhead grew up in million dollar mansions and went to an elite Buckhead private school. It's an unspoken rule that if you have money and you live inside Atlanta, you shouldn't subject your kids to the horrors of public schools. High class shopping(Versace, Lois Vuitton, Gucci, Armani, etc.) can be found at Lenox or Phipps, two huge malls right accross the street from eachother. This district is also home to the city's best dining options, along with the best night spots. Buckhead is also the center of Atlanta's amazingly large Black gay community. Most Black gays are DL and \"straight acting\" so most people cant identify them. If you are woman looking for a Black man in Atanta you might wanna shy away from Buckhead because most likely you would end up being your man's cover. 30327 is a purely sickly wealthy residential community in West Buckhead and was rated the most affluent zip code in the southeast.The kids that grow up in 30327 have no concept of reality whatsoever.Midtown: Midtown has some great restaurants but is known for two things...Piedmont Park(Atlants's largest and nicest park) and being the hub of Atlanta's large gay community. Because Atlanta was invaded by Northerners and Westerners(its hard as hell to find a native Atlantan), people here are very progressive and all races and lifestyles are respected.Downtown: Boring...but home to many coporate headquaters and tourist attractions like the Georgia Aquarium, Grant Park, the CNN Center, Centenial Olympic Park, the MLK Center, etc. Also home to Georgia State University. Not many people actually live downtown. South of Downtown: The ghetto. The gated campuses of Morehouse and Spelman are the only nice attrations on the southside of ATlanta. Notice I did not mention Clark Atlanta because that school is ghetto as hell, but many take pride in that fact.THE BURBS:Sandy Springs: A recently incorporated city just north of Buckhead. Most of the residents are rich as hell. Most of the kids go to private school. Hispanics stay along Roswell Road in apartments but the new mayor, Eva Galambos, has already vowed to tear down alot of the run down apartments along Roswell road and turn then into condos to\"prtect the image of the city\". If that happens Sandy Springs will become the richest city in Georgia. Cobb County: Cobb County is largely white and mostly middle class. East Cobb is the richest area where homes dont exist at prices beneath 500,000 dollars. South Cobb is Black but still middle class, although you wouldnt know it by the way many of the kids act in cities like Smyrna and Mableton. Most everyone in the county stays in homes that are priced from the 200s to the 400s. The exception of course are those that reside in East Cobb where most live in homes around 800-900,000 dollars. Gwinnett: Diverse!!! Like every race on Earth lives in Gwinnett County and the people of Gwinnett are very proud of that. Gwinnett is also economically diverse. You have your dirt poor areas like Norcross where the Mexicans live and your upper middle class areas like the Sugarloaf Country Club in Duluth where the rich white people live. Everything in ATlanta is self segregated according to class and race. Get used to it. Blacks live everywhere in Gwinnett County and so do the Asians. Most of Gwinnett aint so well off though. You'll be hard pressed to find whole communities of wealthy residents. North Fulton: Home to Alpharetta and Roswell. Alpharetta is a city full of rich people. Poor people dont exist there. Its almost entirely white. A large number of Atlanta celebrities live in Alpharetta's score of country clubs including Usher, Whitney Houston, and Ludacris. Roswell is a middle class city...average suburbia.Dekalb County: Segregated. And thats the way the whites and the Blacks prefer it. The white people live in the northern half and the Black people live on the southside of the county. Dunwoody is the prize community of the northern part. It has great public schools and beautiful homes. It also has a huge Jewish population. Decatur is a wanna be ghetto city that has nice homes with thuggish inhabitants. Lithonia and parts of Stone Mountain are rich as hell. And these areas are almost all Black. Clayton County: Ghetto as hell. Home prices dont rise above 250K and crime abounds. A reason why claiming you are from an ATlanta suburb doesnt mean shit.South Fulton: The Cascade neighborhood is famous for being home to ATlanta's Black old money. Every Atlanta Black mayor has lived there. And this includes Shirley Franklin. Cascade is wealthy and its all Black. You name a civil rights leader from ATlanta and they probably own a home in Cascade. Most of their children go to Woodward Academy.

AWD cars are not built for offroading anyways due to low ground clearance and weak frame.AWD capability varies on different but consistant surfaces such as gravel, wet pavement, glare ice but in general does better than rear or front wheel drive.", "example" : "4x4 > AWDFOUR WHEEL DRIVE IS NOT THE SAME AS ALL WHEEL DRIVE.Jeeps, K5 Blazers, etc. ARE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE AND CAN DRIVE OFFROAD.Subaru imprezas, Ford fusions, etc. ARE ALL WHEEL DRIVE AND CANNOT DRIVE OFFROAD.( Rally is not offroad is is racing on a gravel road or maintained dirt road )Cars makers that use AWD include:Subaru, Lamborghini, Suzuki, Ford(Just the Fusion)", "word" : "awd"},{"definition" : "other word for hi or expression of excitement or means yes", "example" : "Awe dog watup? wana go check a movie?awe", "word" : "awe"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "aweary"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "awearied"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "aweather"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "aweband"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "awed"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "awedly"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "awedness"},{"definition" : "\"1337\" way to say away", "example" : "kelvin, go awee and hump a treeorkelvin, get aut and have sex with queenie", "word" : "awee"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "aweek"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "aweel"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "aweigh"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "aweing"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "aweless"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "awelessness"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "awellimiden"},{"definition" : "Social media slang, used to describe something that's awesome, when you don't have the time (nor the character limit) to actually say, awesome.

It rests on a broad base of sacred scriptures that both nourish the soul and provide laws and principles of social interaction. The BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith is the youngest of the world's independent religions. Its founder, BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h (1817-1892), is regarded by BahÃ¡'Ã­s as the most recent in the line of Messengers of God that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Christ and Muhammad.The central theme of BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h's message is that humanity is one single race and that the day has come for its unification in one global society. God, BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h said, has set in motion historical forces that are breaking down traditional barriers of race, class, creed, and nation and that will, in time, give birth to a universal civilization. The principal challenge facing the peoples of the earth is to accept the fact of their oneness and to assist the processes of unification.One of the purposes of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith is to help make this possible. A worldwide community of some five million BahÃ¡'Ã­s, representative of most of the nations, races and cultures on earth, is working to give BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h's teachings practical effect.

Singing a happy song and forgetting the problem is Barney's way of dealing with difficult situations.Children will not be able to handle them on their own.The lasting effects of the show might last well into the teenage years.When they realize that life isn't really what Barney told them it was like,who knows what will happen? Barney also becomes a member of the family often times replacing a parent.On the show, the kids all do what Barney tells them to in perfect conformity without a hint of individual personality.     There is also no clear distinction between reality and what's supposed to be in the kid's imagination.Only in the theme song is it mentioned that Barney is an imaginary character.Most of the show has an appearance of being real.At the \"target\" age, the kids won't know the difference.In some of the scenes, it's pretty obvious because something will appear out of thin air, or Barney will do a super-fast costume change. Many of the scenes which show children interacting with Barney, and Barney solving the problems with a song aren't so obvious.Be careful not to underestimate what your child is taking in.As young children age, their brains become more developed different areas of the brain develop at different rates.This means that a child may understand what he/she's seeing on the screen, but may not be able to communicate it with you.

This is very bad.If a parent does this, they have no idea what messages a show is teaching their kids.Some parents also use Barney as a pacifier. This is one of the worst things any parent can do to their child. Just as a small child becomes dependent on their plastic soother for comfort, they can become dependent on Barney, the biggest pre-school money making machine of the nineties.(Remember that the only reason Barney and Friends is aired is to make money.
