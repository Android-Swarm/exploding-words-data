The country must grow and the implied goal of any fascist nation is to rule the world, and have every human submit to the government.3.\"Nothing against the state\".  Any type of questioning the government is not to be tolerated.  If you do not see things our way, you are wrong.  If you do not agree with the government, you cannot be allowed to live and taint the minds of the rest of the good citizens.The use of militarism was implied only as a means to accomplish one of the three above principles, mainly to keep the people and rest of the world in line.  Fascist countries are known for their harmony and lack of internal strife.  There are no conflicting parties or elections in fascist countries.", "example" : "Nazi Germany was extreme Fascism, better examples of fascist countries were Mussolini's Italy, Iraq, Iran, and many middle eastern countries.Look it up people, I'm not wrong.", "word" : "fascism"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "fascisms"},{"definition" : "1. Someone who believes in a totalitarian state rule by a supreme leader (dictator) who controls everything possible and treats people harshly -- to gain the leader's own success,* to foment an aggressive military nationalism, and to promote a Social Darwinist belief that hard life strengthens the state by weeding out the weak. 2. A lesser authority (corporation, mayor, cop, boss, parent) who legally issues harsh, burdensome, micro-managing, insensitive, or uncaring orders -- especially when they know, or should know, that their goals can be accomplished with more autonomy and much less hardship or distress. 3. A harsh and probably murderous kind of dictator; a \"fascist dictator\" as opposed to a \"benign dictator\".  4. If applied unfairly, a parent authority who is doing their job within reason, but their teen either doesn't agree with their agenda (10 PM curfew to help perform well in morning school), or is insincerely asserting their parent to be a harsh disciplinarian, in order to bond socially with friends.5. If capitalized, is the name of the historic Italian Fascist political party. Benito Mussolini (Il Duce - \"The Leader\") was the Fascist founder and Prime Minister from 1922 to 1943, who built a cult of personality around himself using false media propaganda that he was always right, killed those relatively few unbrainwashed who opposed him, and unified Italy for an incompetent war to retake much of the old Roman empire. Apologists encapsulated their approval of his social control-freakery in the saying, \"Il Duce made the trains run on time\". Background:\"fascist\" connotates an official form of antisocial behavior, if society is understood to have valid comfort needs not met by a harsh authoritarian work ethic or supervision style.\"fascist\" has general application to the misuse of hierarchical power in government, business, and religion, as well as to all other levels of society.  As the global population increases, it will continue as one of the future's most important social issues. \"fascist\" behavior can be observed in some form in everyday life, but is especially obvious on TV when ordered by right-wing politicians, mean bosses, and greedy corporations. Parents can be both fairly or unfairly labeled, because some parents are minor fascists, yet teens can't always tell what is fascist over-control, from what is just good parenting. Near-synonyms: Many folks should have said \"fascist\", if they misused \"nazi\" in poor taste, since the latter is properly reserved for genocide and extermination concerns only. \"fascist\" is different from \"racist\", though racists are often fascists as well. But there are several nation-state military examples where the races have worked together to control the population in arguably fascist or at least military styles. Unwary citizens can be duped by two-faced \"cryptofascist\" policies. For example, people in a dangerous neighborhood might accept a policy of police searching all houses for weapons.

Often misused by people who want to lose weight. Fasting isn't a good way to lose weight, It is however often used to cleans the body if used right. Allow me to explain. In some cutlers and even religions, Many people believe by not eating you are cleansing the soul of toxins. Fasting is only suppose to last 3-7 day's however many people go overboard with this thinking it will help them lose weight. At firsyes, but then the body begins to reganize the fast and will start storing fat in order to keep it from losing precision fuel. On other note, It causes your metabolism to drop down. Yes the way you eat can affect your metabolism and by not eating your metabolism will shut off. I've seen skinny girls who think they are fat and in order to lose weight they try and fast, but they often gain that weight back and it turns into fat. They keep on fasting and more fat added on. Until there body are messed up. Fasting is also a form of bulmia: (Many people think bulmia has to do with purging but this is not always the case. Many woman who are bulmia will fast for 1-2 weeks a month, Thinking it'll make them thin. They do lose weight but only muscle weight. (Muscle helps burn cal's and helps speed up your metabolism.) Fat does not, Fat just slows down the metabolism. So ladies if you are going to fast, Think about this. Do you really want to ruin your body? Here's what fasting can do. (Only if its prolong and misused- Yes its often used to cleans the body of toxins but only if used right, By drinking juices or water for 24-72 hrs, then slowly ad food into your diet, This will keep your body from confonsion. If you are going to use it to cleans your body, only do this every 3-6 months to keep your body from storing fat. Also talk to your doctor about this, (I've done this and got my doctors ok.)Now the list of things it can do If misused. Head-acks Bloating/Stomach pains.Unwanted weight gain. Yo-yo diet (Going from weight to the next.)Dizziness and fainting Memories lossAnd bad breath And death-(Although this is rare, and only caused by those who really over do a fast.)So ladies and gents is your lives/body really worth it?If you want to lose weight fine, but please do it the right way.

I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.And what meaning do you expect your delusionally self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake? You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meatslapper.On a good day you're a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.You smarmy lagerlout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oik artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid. Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know.I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you my not hear from me again for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. Maybe later in life, after you have learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success. True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us 'normal' people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we sometimes forget that there are 'challenged' persons in this world who find these things more difficult. If I had known, that this was your case then I would have never read your post.

The biggest fowling event is held at the Indy 500 \"coca cola lot\" on the saturday before the race. Last year, a record high of 62 teams of two participated in the \"super fowl saturday\" tournament. It has been rumored that even Chuck Norris loves to fowl. The official fruit of fowling is the cherry. The game was invented by mere accident, by three beer drinking men named Chutt, John Von Mack, and Mr. Skip. Fowling has even also raised money for charity!

I am the reason road trips exist. I hope you enjoyed my party last Friday. I can recite the Greek alphabet before the fire of a match burns out. I can rattle off all of my founding fathers as well as my fraternity obligations, but I don't know the words to my school song or my accounting professor's last name. I don't go to class. I never study. I devise elaborate schemes to cheat on my exams. I don't buy books. I have a low GPA. I have an endless supply of doctor notes from the campus health center. I am thankful that my frat buddies will get me a job after graduation because I know that I can't get one on my own. I give more than $1,000 of my parents' money in social dues each year to promote my frat's alcoholism problem. I drink because I am cool. I drink a lot because I am cooler than you.

If I can't find my beer bong I know I can find one next door. I don't binge drink-I continually drink. I have a pre-party for the \"pre-party\". I can dance. I wear my letters. I billboard my frat on sweatshirts. Most of my T-shirts are frat T's from frat parties. I wear long sleeved T-shirts under short sleeved T's. I own many plaid button-downs. I tuck in the front and let the back hang out. I own one baseball hat. I live in my khakis. I wear Timberlands in the winter and sandals in the summer. Sometimes I wear sandals in the winter because I can. I drive a sport utility vehicle my dad paid for. I play with my dog in the front lawn. My hair is a mess yet totally in style. I sometimes don't shave for weeks at a time. I am vogue. Ladies love me, but more importantly, I know ladies love me. I will never commit to just one girl. I don't wear condoms because it doesn't feel as good. I believe a girl gives up her right to say \"no\" if she is in my frat house after 1:30 a.m. I am shady. I don't care about what girls have to say. I only care about me. I will say anything to get a girl into bed. I will say even more to get a freshman girl in bed because I know she'll believe me. I am a player. I am loud and obnoxious wherever I go in public. I live in filth. I enjoy the smell of old beer in carpet. I prefer a dingy frat house to a clean apartment. I think living among rodents builds character. I leave the seat up. I can't clean up after myself. I put on a great front for parent's weekend. No one can see through me. I know every word to every song by Willie Nelson, David Alan Coe, and the Grateful Dead. I will sing them for you if I haven't picked up by nights end. I can't remember my parent's home phone number, but I do know every digit to their calling card number. I haze my pledges. I make them eat and drink things you would not imagine.
