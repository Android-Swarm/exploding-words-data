The greatest concentrations of hipsters can be found living in the Williamsburg, Wicker Park, and Mission District neighborhoods of major cosmopolitan centers such as New York, Chicago, and San Francisco respectively.  Although \"hipsterism\" is really a state of mind,it is also often intertwined with distinct fashion sensibilities. Hipsters reject the culturally-ignorant attitudes of mainstream consumers, and are often be seen wearing vintage and thrift store inspired fashions, tight-fitting jeans, old-school sneakers, and sometimes thick rimmed glasses.  Both hipster men and women sport similar androgynous hair styles that include combinations of messy shag cuts and asymmetric side-swept bangs.  Such styles are often associated with the work of creative stylists at urban salons, and are usually too \"edgy\" for the culturally-sheltered mainstream consumer.  The \"effortless cool\" urban bohemian look of a hipster is exemplified in Urban Outfitters and American Apparel ads which cater towards the hipster demographic. Despite misconceptions based on their aesthetic tastes, hipsters tend to be well educated and often have liberal arts degrees, or degrees in maths and sciences, which also require certain creative analytical thinking abilities.  Consequently many hipsters tend to have jobs in the music, art, and fashion industries.  It is a myth that most hipsters are unemployed and live off of their parent's trust funds.        Hipsters shun mainstream societal conventions that apply to dating preferences and traditional \"rules\" of physical attraction.  It is part of the hipster central dogma not to be influenced by mainsream advertising and media, which tends to only promote ethnocentric ideals of beauty.  The concepts of androgyny and feminism have influenced hipster culture, where hipster men are often as thin as the women they date. The muscular and athletic all-American male ideal is not seen as attractive by confident and culturally-empowered hipster women who instead view them as symbols of male oppression, sexism, and misogyny.  Likewise, culturally-vapid sorority-type girls with fake blond hair, overly tanned skin, and \"Britney Spears tube-tops\" are not seen as attractive by cultured hipster males who instead see them as symbols of female insecurity, low self-esteem, and lack of cultural intelligence and independent thinking.  Hipsters are also very racially open-minded, and the greatest number of interracial couples in any urban environment are typically found within the hipster subculture.       Although hipsters are technically conformists within their own subculture, in comparison to the much larger mainstream mass, they are pioneers and leaders of the latest cultural trends and ideals.  For example, the surge of jeans made to look old and worn (i.e. \"distressed\"), that have become prevalent at stores such as The Gap, American Eagle, Abercrombie and Fitch, and Hollister, were originally paraded by hipsters who shopped in thrift stores years before such clothing items were mass produced and sold to the mainstream consumer.  The true irony here is that many of the detractors of hipster culture are in fact unknowingly following a path that hipsters have carved out years before them.  This phenomena also applies to music as well, as many bands have become successful and known to mainstream audiences only because hipsters first found and listened to them as early-adopters of new culture.  Once certain concepts of fashion and music have reached mainstream audiences, hipsters move on to something new and improved.     Because of the rise of various online photo-blog and social networking sites, insights into urban hipster culture is reaching sheltered suburban audiences at an exponential rate.  Cultural \"norms\" have been deconstructed by hipster culture as a whole. Hipsterism is often dismissed as just an image thing by some, but the culture as a whole is effecting changes in society, leading to feelings of insecurity and resentment in people who are no longer a part of the cultural ruling class. For example, a lot of anti-hipster sentiment evidently comes from culturally-clueless suburban frat boy types who feel that the more sensitive, intelligent, and culturally aware hipster ideal threatens their insecure sense of masculinity.  Anti-hipster sentiment often comes from people who simply can't keep up with social change and are envious of those who can.", "example" : "A conversation outside a hipster bar in downtown NYC:Frat Boy #1:  Dude, are you having any luck picking up     chicks in there?Frat Boy #2:  Man...I haven't experienced anything like this before.

True Hollywood Stories\" and what G4's seems to have modeled this show after, \"Intimate Portrait\". This show represents the best and worst aspects of G4. Best because it shows the channel does have the potential to do some intelligent, and informative programming. The episodes are mostly great and even the most hardcore G4 haters will give the show lots of love. In fact, for many it's because of G4 not wanting to do anything else as intelligent as Icons that many lash out at the channel and it's other shows. It represents the worst of G4 because even though the show is almost always well meaning, alot of G4's greed, ignorance, and personal politics manage to slip through and rear it's ugly head. Probably the earliest example of this was when the show was first getting started and doing great with viewers until G4 started abusing the shows name declaring all kinds of new, crappy games that which some weren't even out, Icons. The first was the infamous TLOR scandal where they declared a crappy new game based on the license an Icons before it was even out. Then they did Splinter Cell and Xbox Icons, but again, this was way before Splinter Cell was what we all know today, all these we're really just infomercials not histories. People on the boards we're pissed and it seemed like G4 got the point and gave the sleazy crap a rest. Once again though, the nonsense continued with more fake Icon infomercials about Hunter, Tron, and Onimusha and again people bitched and the nonsense stopped for a while. As if the whoring wasn't enough, the show then and now, hardly ever got any updates and even the reruns we're hardly ever on compared to the other shows. To make it even worse, G4 insisted on an incredibly unfulfilling, and really downright disrespectful half-hour timeslot considering just how important and influential the subjects they cover are. Still, the show trudged on and kept releasing good eps here and there. Although again more letdowns, probably one of the absolute worst was when what probably should have been one of the most important Icons ever, Id, became nothing but a cheap promo for Doom III. The problem with these episodes is the staff that makes Icons also does another show called \"Gamemaker Specials\" which is a dedicated game infomercial show. This should be great for everyone, but the problem is some of the powers that be force the staff to let both shows just \"happen\" to overlap with one another from time to time. Now, here's the bad. The show of recent has totally been changed for the most part to make it as casual as can be.

The YIP! was dedicated to merging New Left activism and the hippie counterculture to create a revolution that would be both personal and political--as well as fun.  Yippies tended to gather in large cities, particularly in Manhattan's Lower East Side, where Rubin and Hoffman both lived during the 1960s.  Yippies rejected all -isms, including socialism and anarchism, in favor of the motto of \"Do your own thing\"--i.e., don't conform to a specific system of belief but rather be an individual.  At the same time, collective action was at the root of Yippie activism, and Yippies participated in \"be-ins\" (normally associated with hippies) and other collective gatherings.  And although the YIP! did not promote any one -ism (and, despite Hoffman and Rubin's involvement, was a self-proclaimed \"leaderless\" movement), the \"party\" was extremely leftist, advocating social justice for all and arguing that all property--including housing, clothing, and food--should be FREE.  The Yippies' most famous actions include the attack on the New York Stock Exchange (when Yippies threw money to the floor and watched as those below fought for it) and their involvement at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, at which they nominated a pig for president.  Much of the Yippies' activism consisted of guerrilla street theater and symbolic acts (such as that at the NYSE) to make a point; Yippies understood the power of the media and sought press to disseminate their revolutionary messages with a pointed disinterest in the accuracy of the stories told about them.
