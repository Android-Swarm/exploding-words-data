The Distinction between Overstanding and Understanding is a matter of context and awareness. To overstand is to comprehend a thing itself AND to have knowledge of why it is the way it is and of its place or role in the grand scheme of things. If you can use something or do a job, you understand and memorize enough to to act. (be a competent consumer of it) one who understands may also be able to innovate or redesign but otherwise accepts the boundaries of a thing as given. Understanding can Drive the car, maybe fix it, maybe even design or improve it within its basic structure.  Overstanding realizes that the design is imperfect in the way it is for reasons beyond simple engineering. For example, overstanding knows that we could have cars that use less or no gasoline but that we won't because it is not in the interest of those who control the making of cars to make them last longer, be more efficient, less expensive etc. They make their money when you buy, fuel and fix the car, so why would they help you take thier money away? Nevermind pollution or helping poor folks out.The difference between Under and Over standing is the difference between seeing and acting with awareness or blindly playing a role. Understanding does the Job, and maybe even wrote the Business Plan (the person who wrote the business plan may understand how to set up businesses). What distinguishes Over from Under is their awareness of the forces that move things.  One who overstands sees power for what it is, but may or may not hold and use power in the obvious sense. One who overstands knows that the business will succeed only if it extracts value from others and so is inherrently predatory.  One who overstands this fact may accept it and play anyway or refuse to exploit others. Overstanding emerged as a word from the global hip hop culture, to help portray the distinction between the understanding that life is difficult and the overstanding that life is more difficult than it need be because it is in the interest of those in power to keep things as they are. Overstanding should help but does not always liberate people.

However, some strains of bacteria have developed resistance to this antibiotic, which has reduced its effectiveness for treating some types of infection.Oxytetracycline is still used to treat infections caused by chlamydia (e.g. the chest infection psittacosis, the eye infection trachoma, and the genital infection urethritis) and infections caused by mycoplasma organisms (e.g. pneumonia).", "example" : "Oxytetracycline is used to treat acne, due to its activity against the bacteria on the skin that cause acne (Propionebacterium acnes).

Pimps and hoes (radio and record labels) run this game and, of course, it's all about money. Music doesn't matter. Artists don't matter. Music fans don't matter.

Keeping music fans unaware, keeping artists scared, and keeping radio's pockets fat are what's keeping this bulls**t alive and well.If you or anyone that you know want's a career in the music industry, please read what I have written below. I hate to say it, but all of the time and effort and money that you have spent trying to become a great artist or musician may get you NOWHERE because of the amount of corruption in the music industry. You need to know the truth, and here it is. Spread the word!2) In the music industry, \"payola\" is when record labels (and their middlemen) pay radio to play songs and to play those songs over and over WITHOUT disclosing the fact that the songs were paid for to the radio's listeners. Payola is illegal, and it's unfair to both artists and music fans. \"Pay for play\" is different than \"payola\". \"Pay for play\" is when a radio station gets paid to play a song on the radio, but discloses to its listeners the fact that the song was paid for. \"Pay for play\" is legal, but it rarely happens because most radio stations aren't stupid enough to disclose the fact that they care more about getting paid to play a song than they care about playing a song because it's a great song. Both \"payola\" and \"pay for play\" are conflicts of interests. In other words, both put people in a position to do the \"wrong\" thing because they will personally benefit from doing the wrong thing.For example, if a record label bribes a radio station $10,000 to play a CRAPPY song, and another record label doesn't bribe the radio station to play an EXCELLENT song, ninety percent of the radio stations WILL TAKE THE MONEY AND PLAY THE CRAPPY SONG...OVER AND OVER AND OVER.A lot of radio stations FORCE record labels (and their middlemen) to bribe them to play songs so both radio and the record labels are at fault. Some naive people don't see the problem with payola. You may ask \"Well how is radio supposed to make money?\". Radio makes its money from its sponsors. That's just the way it goes. Some folks try and justify payola by saying that DJ's don't get paid enough money. That doesn't give them the right to ruin today's music, to screw over truly talented artists or to scam music fans. Get another job, but don't scam the public! \"Payola\" money is \"greedy\" money. Radio stations and record labels do NOT own the airwaves. The airwaves belong to the public.You may think that radio stations are just playing the songs that its listeners request. Absolutely not! That's just what they want you to ASSUME, and most listeners get caught in the trap. They think that because a radio station plays a song over and over that most people must like the song. Record labels and radio count on the fact that sometimes unsuspecting listeners will force themselves into liking a song (that they don't like) just because they believe that a lot of other listeners like it. It's a trap, and peer pressure is a bitch.Payola is Music Biz Prostitution..plain and simple The big boys in the music industry will NEVER do anything to stop payola because it keeps their pockets fat. Artists will never do anything to stop payola because most artists are very dependent on the SNAKES in the music industry.Music fans are the key to fighting payola. Music fans are our ONLY HOPE, but most music fans are not aware of payola. Why? Because payola happens on both radio and TV. You're not gonna hear a lot about (the evil whore named)payola on radio or TV because it's their \"dirty little secret\". And since it's very hard to spread the truth about payola to the masses without the help of radio or TV, they're doing a great job of keeping the public in the dark about the fact that payola even exists.It can't be emphasized how the VAST, OVERWHELMING percentage of what you are hearing on today's commercial radio and TV (MTV) is because some greedy bastards (from a record label) paid some other greedy bastard who works at a radio or TV station. If there is a radio station that plays a bunch of crap over and over again, you can bet your bottom dollar that they are a payola infested radio station.If you think today's music sucks, it's because of payola. It's not because today's artists suck. There are plenty of super talented artists out there who we (music fans) will NEVER know about because those artists are on independent labels who can't afford to bribe radio. Or they are artists who are fed up with all of the corruption in the music industry and refuse to put up with it any longer.If you love commercial radio, if you love MTV, if you love all of the mainstream music that's out there, remember this: There are probably thousands of artists out there that are twice as good (as the artists that you like)that you will NEVER EVER know about because of payola.", "example" : "Boycott commercial radio!!

A 'Partner' is very similar to a boyfriend or girlfriend, but is not a boyfriend or girl friend. If you call someone's 'Partner' a 'boyfriend' or a 'girlfriend', you will be corrected (\"no, Callum is my 'Partner'\"). 'Partners' have many of the same characteristics as boyfriends and girlfriends (functioning genitalia, heartbeats, annoying habits, feelings, etc...), but also have very distinctive behaviors and physical features: * 'Partners' live in \"spaces\", not apartments, homes, houses, pads or places. * 'Partners' sleep and fuck on futons or dirty mattresses on the floor, as opposed to beds.  * 'Partners' generally subsist on 'ethical' or sustainable diets of Organic vegetables, Free-range meat and fair-trade coffee. * Often, a male 'partner' can be recognized by the presence of frappichino glasses, fashionably-unfashionable clothes, 'old-man' or 'quasi-military' hats, a deliberately messy hair-do  odd facial hair patterns and a generally wimpish and elitist attitude. It is not uncommon for a male 'partner' to undergo sympathy cramps while the female partner is menstruating.* Female 'partners' are often distinguished by the accumulation of hair on the legs and arm-pits, but not necessarily the genital area. The female partner usually sports boyish clothes, Retro tees, or DIY skirts and blouses made of discarded towels , curtains or tablecloths. leg warmers would not be out of place here. Hair styles can vary from one similar to the male partner's deliberate mess, to a Zelda hair-cut. Female 'Partners' usually can be found in bars, at a table with 3 or 4 guys, in addition to her 'partner' who is quietly sipping his micro-brewed bitter-nut-dark-ale while stewing in jealousy.       * A 'partner' is generally chosen on their potential to advance one's own status in a given scene. A leader of an activist group, a drummer of a post-rock band or the focus of a peer group is generally considered prime 'partner' material. Having a good 'partner' increases your ability to name-drop, facilitates ladder climbing and makes for a fashionable conversation piece. * 'Partners' frown on dating, as it is an outdated tradition of monogamous courtship. Instead they go on \"meetings\" at such venues as cheap ethnic restaurants, diners, cultural festivals, downtown parks, wooded areas and their or their 'partners' \"space\". * 'Partners' can be of great importance one day, and a minor annoyance to be ignored, avoided or kicked to the curb the next. This is because people in 'partnerships' generally strive to avoid any commitment or responsibility in a life devoted to the pursue of their own pleasure, and likely have other 'partners' lined up, if they're not fucking them already.  * Although the term 'partner' suggests equality in a relationship, this is not the case. The power in the relationship rests with the 'partner' that cares less. As one 'Partner' loses interest, they become harder and harder to arrange a 'meeting' with. leaving the other 'partner(s)' confused as to the state of the decaying 'partnership' leading to desperation and insecurity. * The term 'partner' is not exclusive to those in monogamous relationships. Often, those choosing open relationships refer to each other as 'partners'. hence, it is possible for someone to have multiple 'partners' and 'partnerships'. This helps facilitate the spread of STDs amongst bohemian, activist and alternative circles.  * The term 'Partner' is not exclusive to straight relationships. In fact, the term has been borrowed (co-opted or colonized... if you will) from the L.G.B.T. community which used the term to denote a participant in a same-sex relationship. Gay people resent straight people who have bastardized and colonized the term, just as black people resent white people who have co-opted hip-hop music.", "example" : "Metrosexual: \"Oh, Charlie's my partner.

One on each arm and leg and one on his side.The only band to my knowledge that uses this symbol is the hard rock band Godsmack. An inverted star is used in Satanism. It represents either pointing toward Hell or a goats head (depending on how you look at it.) Some heavy metal bands such as Slayer and the newer Drowning pool use this symbol.", "example" : "For a more in-depth look at the pentagram and its many meanings, visit www.religioustolerance.org/wic_pent.html", "word" : "pentagram"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentagrammatic"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentagrid"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentahalide"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentahedra"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentahedral"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentahedrical"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentahedroid"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentahedron"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentahedrous"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentahexahedral"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentahexahedron"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentahydrate"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentahydrated"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentahydric"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentahydroxy"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentail"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentaiodide"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentalobate"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentalogy"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentalogies"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentalogue"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentalpha"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentamera"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentameral"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentameran"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentamery"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentamerid"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentameridae"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentamerism"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentameroid"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentamerous"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentamerus"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentameter"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentameters"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentamethylene"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentamethylenediamine"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentametrist"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentametrize"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentander"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentandria"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentandrian"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentandrous"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentane"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentanedione"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentanes"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentangle"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentangular"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentanitrate"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentanoic"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentanolide"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentanone"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentapeptide"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentapetalous"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentaphylacaceae"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentaphylacaceous"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentaphylax"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentaphyllous"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentaploid"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentaploidy"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentaploidic"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentapody"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentapodic"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentapodies"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentapolis"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentapolitan"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentaprism"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentapterous"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentaptych"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentaptote"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "pentaquin"}]
