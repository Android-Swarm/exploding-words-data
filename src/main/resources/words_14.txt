Turner Catledge, former editor of the New York Times, called grits \"the first truly American food.\" Grits date as far back as 1607, when the colonists came ashore at Jamestown, Virginia. Grits are a good source of calcium and iron and have no fat or cholesterol. Grits are made from the milling of corn kernels. The first step in the process is to clean the kernels; then, the grains are steamed for a short time to loosen the tough outer hull. The grain kernel is split, which removes the hull and germ, leaving the broken endosperm. Heavy steel rollers break up the endosperm into granules, which are separated by a screening process. The large-size granules are the grits; the smaller ones become cornmeal and corn flour. The word grits comes from the Old English. \"grytt\", for \"bran\", but the Old English \"greot\" also meant something ground. ", "example" : "There's nothing better than a bowl of grits for breakfast; it's comfort food and fills you up with warmth.

Hallucinations can be quite deceiving (especially if it is a mix of a visual images, sound and even the sensation of touch) and, like dreams, sometimes you know it\u2019s not real but other times you are unsure. Also like dreams, hallucinating can warp or distort your thinking, causing you to know things you shouldn\u2019t and to completely forget things that are common sense, obvious and every day practice.There are five different types of hallucination:* visual (seeing things)* auditory (hearing things)* olfactory (smelling things)* gustatory (tasting things)* tactile (feeling things)Often, two or more of these will be mixed together at the same time.Hallucinating can happen to anyone at all, and at any age. Some people hallucinate on a daily basis, while others may only experience it once and even then very briefly in their entire life.Taking certain drugs may result in hallucinating, while for others, they may hallucinate because they have a mental illness or even for no obvious reason at all (even though there probably is a reason).

The primary active substance is THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) although several other cannabinoids are known to occur.Hash is usually smoked in pipes, water pipes, joints, and hookahs, sometimes mixed with cannabis flowers or tobacco. It can also be eaten.The most common effects of hash and cannabis are: a sense of wellbeing, relaxation, rapid flow of ideas, increased appreciation of music and food, heightened senses, sleepiness, pain relief, nausea relief and increased appetite.There are also several negative effects including dry mouth, rapid heart beat, impaired short term memory, anxiety, and panic attacks.Contrary to popular belief, the effects from smoking cannabis or hash are not increased by holding the smoke in the lungs longer. Almost all of the THC is absorbed within the first few seconds.  Also contrary to popular belief, more potent cannabis or hash is not more dangerous.  Users generally take enough of the substance until they achieve the desired effects.  In the case of smoking, it means the user will have to inhale less smoke and therefore fewer toxins to achieve the same effect.Most high school students report that it is easier for them to obtain cannabis than alcohol.  This is possibly due to the fact that people who sell cannabis are already breaking the law and have few problems with selling to minors.  Despite ever-increasing spending on prosecution of cannabis users and anti-drug misinformation, some 50% of high school seniors report having tried cannabis.Hash is currently illegal in countries where the government feels it is best to make decisions for an individual, including what consenting adults do in the privacy of their homes.", "example" : "Hash should be regulated and sold like alcohol.", "word" : "hash"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "hashab"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "hashabi"},{"definition" : "The state of being in an altered frame of mind, specifically relating to pot (baked) and acid (fried).

The two frequencies are combined in a nonlinear signal-processing device such as a vacuum tube, transistor, or diode, usually called a mixer. In the most common application, two signals at frequencies f1 and f2 are mixed, creating two new signals, one at the sum f1 + f2 of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference f1 − f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically only one of the new frequencies is desired, and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer.

I like to describe it as being \"in the music\". Different music can have different effects on you. old school rock can make you trip out or go crazy. rap can make you freestyle better than you ever thought possible. techno can actually sound cool. your balance and coordination are afffected when you are high. you frequently move around and almost fall if you're high enough. simple tasks (like typing this) can be a lot harder when you're high. also watching things can be different, particulary animated things. I strongly recomend watchin the animatrix while high to find out what im talkin about. i tried my best to explain being high, but really the only way to understand it is to get high yourself. so, for you five who have never gotten high, go get lots of weed and smoke it now!

It is a way of living more than a religion. The many forms of Hinduism are henotheistic religions. They recognize a single deity, and view other Gods and Goddesses as manifestations or aspects of that supreme God. Henotheistic and polytheistic religions have traditionally been among the world's most religiously tolerant faiths. Hindus are divided into four groups, namely the brahmins(priests), kshatriyas(warriors), vaishyas(traders) and harijans(workers).     India was(and still is) the land of hindus, there is no other country which we can call our own.India was ruled by Muslims for 1000 years and then christians(British) for 200 years, even then Hinduism existed, thanks to the warrior clans of sikhs,marathas and rajputs. We have never tried to convert other people by force, bribe or lure, although fresh converts are welcome. The sacred texts of Hinduism are Bhagwad Gita( the word of Lord Krishna ),Ramayana( the legend of Prince Ram ), Mahabharata( the second longest epic in the world,it describes the biggest ever war in India,fought at Kurukshetra,and the lessons to learn from it) and the Vedas ( the principles of Hindu living).
