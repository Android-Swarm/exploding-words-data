Once cooked, bones and fat are discarded, the meat is reserved, and (dry) cornmeal is boiled in the broth to make a mush. The meat, finely minced, is returned, and seasonings, typically sage, thyme, savory, and others, are added. The mush is cast into loaves, and allowed to cool thoroughly until gelled. The proportions and seasoning are very much a matter of the region and the cook's taste.Commercial scrapple often contains these traditional ingredients, with a distinctive flavor to each brand, though homemade recipes often specify more genteel cuts of pork, with a consequently blander taste. A few manufacturers have introduced beef and turkey varieties.Scrapple is typically cut into thin (quarter-inch-thick) slices, pan-fried in butter or oil until the outsides form a crust, and served at breakfast, as an accompaniment to eggs. It is eaten plain or with ketchup, maple syrup, dark corn syrup, or apple butter.In some regions, however, such as New England, it is prepared by mixing the scrapple with scrambled eggs and served with toast.", "example" : "mmmmm.

In the story-line of the C&C3 world, somewhere in the middle of the 21st century, the scrin invade a tiberium infested earth. The invasion was triggered by the waste laid to tiberium by the firing of the ion cannon by GDI on temple prime, during the escalated NOD vs GDI conflict.Scrin in multiplayer are often considered overpowered, both in C&C3 Tiberium Wars and the expansion C&C3 Kane's Wrath. Although beatable, many players good and bad, will agree that the race is overpowered, for the sheer reason that it is much easier to win while playing with scrin (while the effort put into winning should be the same for all 3 factions!) This happens due to: 1) the high effectiveness of their units against infantry, vehicles and air. Many units are specialized to handle all 3. 2) Most of scrin support powers are immediate and not too expensive, so they often cripple opponents early by \"point and click\" as soon as they reach tier II. 3)Also, their harvesters move both faster and collect resources faster, so you will often have scrin players teching up less than 3 minutes, while for NOD or GDI this will take a while longer. 4)Finally, as it is currently in the expansion pack Kane's Wrath - scrin are especially overpowered, because of the mechapede. Players will tech up in less than 3 minutes and have 2 or 3 mechapedes ready, while most NOD and GDI players will still be building their tech center, or focus on tanks, which are useless against the mechapede.As mentioned earlier, scrin are beatable, but it takes more skill, effort and time to beat a good scrin player than to beat a good GDI/NOD player, which indicates an imbalance.Aside from the story-line, the scrin thus are often considered homoerotic.

The pancreas and stomach are unusual in that their secretions contain both endocrine (insulin) and exocrine (digestive) hormones. The female breast secretes milk and is an exocrine gland. The testis is a highly specialised mixed gland with both endocrine (testosterone) and exocrine (sperm)functions.  The female ovary is a specialised mixed gland also.The word is also used loosely to describe mucous-like substances which are transudates or exudates.

Selvage is the term commonly used to refer to denim that has been produced on a shuttle loom. Since the amount of fabric produced from a shuttle loom is significantly narrower than a projectile (wide) loom, the cotton consumption is higher and the time required is greater. In selvage jeans, you will see the actual edge of the fabric where the weaving stops and is finished by the loom, as opposed to denim woven on a projectile loom, where the fabric has been cut off at the ends.

After yugoslavia was made the backstabing and hatred of the serbians began. the croatians in particular proved how much they hated serbians during the second world war by killing thousands of serb civillins, which was the thanks serbia got for saving them in the first world war. in stead of choosing a serbian to lead yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito was choosen a half Croat half Slovene - big mistake. the second world war soon coming to an end and the chetniks and partisans were ploting a attack to sweep through croatia, liberate the concentration camps and kill any remianing Fascists. Tito did not allow this plan to proceed as he said that the croatians are serbia's \"brother\" and that everything will be back to normal after the war. Tito had long planned to tear yugoslavia apart and destroy serbia, Tito put all the money into croatia and slovania and so when tito died yugoslavia would collapse. while tito lived, it was his personal prestige that was holding yugoslavia together. In 1989 Slobodan Milosevic was elected as president of serbia. although Milosevic was not such a great president he still wanted to unify yugoslavia and the serbian people. Slobodan Milosevic has made alot of mistakes and if were prevented from happening, serbia would be in a much better position. In 1999 NATO launched a illegal bombing campaign causing a massive humanitarian catastrophe. NATO bombing went on for 79 days, the biggest bombing campaign in history. By may 1999 NATO and US airforce supremacy was warning and urging Milosevic to sign a truce and allow NATO peacekeeper's into kosovo. If Milosovic had kept fight just for one more week, serbia would have won and would be in a totally differnt position and Milosevic would have been a world hero. This is just another example of a bad decision made by the serbians. On April 1, 2001 President Milosevic was arrested and imprisoned by the Serbian Government of the so-called \u201cDemocratic Opposition of Serbia,\u201d On June 28, 2001, St. Vitus Day, the holiest day on the Serbian Orthodox calendar, the Government of the Republic of Serbia, in a humiliating display of treason, illegally kidnapped President Milosevic and handed him over to    the Hague Tribunal which flagrantly violated not only the Constitutions of Serbia and of Yugoslavia, but also of numerous international statutes regarding the extradition of prisoners.this shows the treachery and backstabing of the serbian people and that was a very big mistake handing over Milosevic like that. Milosevic should have been trialed in serbia by the serbians instead of handing him over to the Hague. serbians are not a united country which is why everything has gone wrong for the serbs.", "word" : "serbians"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "serbize"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "serbonian"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "serbophile"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "serbophobe"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "sercial"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "sercom"},{"definition" : "An ancient Egyptian structure inside the tomb of an Egyptian ruler, royal family member, or nobleman that contains the Ka Statue.

If you don't want to do the shake, you are also able to do the \"I'm tuff\" motion. In a downward motion, move your hand. Giving a kind of downward wrist flick at the end.

Sheol is the most common word to be substituted by the word hell. Bible scriptures that describe the characteristics of Sheol explain it to be exactly how we would describe our dead; buried under the ground, no consciousness, no knowledge, no pain, no joy, no hope. King Solomon explained the unconscious state of the dead in detail when describing sheol \u2013\n\nEcclesiastes 9:10Whatever your hands find to do, do with all your strength, because there is no work, planning, knowledge, or wisdom in Sheol where you are going.\n\nEcclesiastes 9:5-6For the living know that they will die, but the dead don't know anything. There is no longer a reward for them because the memory of them is forgotten. Their love, their hate, and their envy have already disappeared, and there is no longer a portion for them in all that is done under the sun.\n\nSince hell replaces Sheol it has to mean the same thing as Sheol. So if hell means a place of anguish for unrighteous people, why would Job ask God to put him there until he was resurrected?\n\nJob 14:13If only You would hide me in Sheol and conceal me until Your anger passes, that You would appoint a time for me and then remember me.\n\nAnd when Jacob believed his son had died, Jacob said that he would go down into Sheol mourning for him \u2013 Genesis 37:35\n\nAll his sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. \"No,\" he said. \"I will go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.\" And his father wept for him.\n\nWhat Jacob meant by this is that he was not soon going to stop mourning for his son; he felt so bad he said that he would mourn his son until the day that he himself died and went to Sheol, or the grave. There he would join his son in death, waiting to be resurrected. Jacob didn\u2019t mean that his son or he would be in a place of fiery punishment after death, just the place of the dead.\n\nThere are also poetic and symbolic descriptions of these places in the bible that may cause confusion. You may read about someone \u201ccrying out\u201d to God from Sheol or death. These passages are often taken literally to try and prove that there is consciousness in death, but these are merely forms of poeticism to describe that the injustice of a good person who has died \u201ccries out\u201d to God to make things right and resurrect him. Like \u2013\n\nPsalm 18:5-6The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.\n\nIn my distress I called upon Jehovah, And cried unto my God: He heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry before him came into his ears.\n\nTake passages such as this into consideration \u2013 Genesis 4:10Then He said, \"What have you done? Your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground!\n\nAbel\u2019s blood did not cry out to God anymore than the Psalmist recorded a cry out to God from death. What this means is that all injustice in the world is considered a cry out to God.

The Clean Shit The kind where you feel shit come out, see shit in the bowl, but there's no shit on the toilet paper. The Wet Shit You wipe your ass fifty times and it still feels unwiped. So you end up putting toilet paper between your ass and your underwear so you don't ruin them with those dreadful skid marks. The Second Wave Shit This shit happens when you've finished, your pants are up to your knees, and you suddenly realize you have to shit some more. The Brain Hemorrahage Through Your Nose Shit Also known as \"Pop a Vein in Your Forehead Shit\". You have to strain so much to get it out that you turn purple and practically have a stroke. The Corn Shit No explanation necessary. The Lincoln Log Shit The kind of shit that's so enormous you're afraid to flush it down without first breaking it up into little pieces with the toilet brush. The Nororius Drinker Shit The kind of shit you have the morning after a long night of drinking. It's most noticeable trait is the tread mark left on the bottom of the toilet bowl after you flush. The \"Gee, I Really Wish I Could Shit\" Shit The kind where you want to shit, but even after straining your guts out, all you can do is sit on the toilet, cramped and farting. The Wet Cheeks Shit Also known as the \"Power Dump\". That's the kind that comes out of your ass so fast that your butt cheeks get splashed with the toilet water. The Liquid Shit That's the kind where yellowish-brown liquid shoots out of your butt, splashes all over the side of the toilet bowl and, at the same time, chronically burns your tender poop-chute. The Mexican Food Shit A class all on its own. The Crowd Pleaser This shit is so intriguing in size and/or appearance that you have to show it to someone before flushing. The Mood Enhancer This shit occurs after a lengthy period of constipation, thereby allowing you to be your old self again. The Ritual This shit occurs at the same time each day and is accomplished with the aid of a newspaper. The Guinness Book Of Records Shit A shit so noteworthy it should be recorded for future generations. The Aftershock Shit This shit has an odour so powerful than anyone entering the vicinity within the next seven hours is affected. The \"Honeymoon's Over\" Shit This is any shit created in the presence of another person. The Groaner A shit so huge it cannot exit without vocal assistance. The Floater Characterized by its floatability, this shit has been known to resurface after many flushings. The Ranger A shit which refuses to let go. It is usually necessary to engage in a rocking or bouncing motion, but quite often the only solution is to push it away with a small piece of toilet paper. The Phantom Shit This appears in the toilet mysteriously and no one will admit to putting it there. The Peek-A-Boo Shit Now you see it, now you don't. This shit is playing games with you. Requires patience and muscle control. The Bombshell A shit that comes as a complete surprise at a time that is either inappropriate to shit (i.e. during lovemaking or a root canal) or you are nowhere near shitting facilities. The Snake Charmer A long skinny shit which has managed to coil itself into a frightening position - usually harmless. The Olympic Shit This shit occurs exactly one hour prior to the start of any competitive event in which you are entered and bears a close resemblance to the Drinker's Shit. The Back-To-Nature Shit This shit may be of any variety but is always deposited either in the woods or while hiding behind the passenger side of your car. The Pebbles-From-Heaven Shit An adorable collection of small turds in a cluster, often a gift from God when you actually can't shit. Premeditated Shit Laxative induced. Doesn't count. Shitzopherenia Fear of shitting - can be fatal! Energizer Vs. Duracell Shit Also known as a \"Still Going\" shit. The Power Dump Shit The kind that comes out so fast, you barely get your pants down when you're done. The Liquid Plumber Shit This kind of shit is so big it plugs up the toilet and it overflows all over the floor. (You should have followed the advice from the Lincoln Log Shit.) The Spinal Tap Shit The kind of shit that hurts so much coming out, you'd swear it's got to be coming out sideways. The \"I Think I'm Giving Birth Through My Asshole\" Shit Similar to the Lincoln Log and The Spinal Tap Shits. The shape and size of the turd resembles a tall boy beer can. Vacuous air space remains in the rectum for some time afterwards. The Porridge Shit The type that comes out like toothpaste, and just keeps on coming. You have two choices: a) flush and keep going, or b) risk it piling up to your butt while you sit there helpless. The \"I'm Going To Chew My Food Better\" Shit When the bag of Doritos you ate last night lacerates the insides of your rectum on the way out in the morning. The \"I Think I'm Turning Into A Bunny\" Shit When you drop lots of cute, little round ones that look like marbles and make tiny splashing sounds when they hit the water. The \"What The Hell Died In Here?\" Shit Also sometimes referred to as \"The Toxic Dump\". Of course you don't warn anyone of the poisonous bathroom odour. Instead, you stand innocently near the door and enjoy the show as they run out gagging and gasping for air. The \"I Just Know There's A Turd Still Dangling There\" Shit Where you just sit there patiently and wait for the last cling-on to drop off because if you wipe now, it's going to smear all over the place.
