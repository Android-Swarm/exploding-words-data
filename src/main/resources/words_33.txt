Leibniz took the approach that this was the \"best of all possible worlds,\" meaning that God could not have made this world better in any one respect, without making it worse in others.In 1759, Voltaire published the novel *Candide* which was essentially a very long satire of Leibniz' views.  The character of Dr. Pangloss is based on Leibniz, although it has been argued that Voltaire misrepresented Leibniz' views.In common usage, the term *theodicy* refers to any defense of a thing based on the claim that whatever that thing does is the best possible.  The obvious example is neoclassical economics, which insists that whatever outcome achieved by \"the market,\" it is the best one that could possibly exist.

After the fall of the Qing, china became a republic under the nationalist government and Britain, Tibet and China decide what to do with Tibet.  Britain recognized Tibet as under chinese Suzerainty just like Russia recogzized Mongolia.  Similiar to Mongolia, the British drew up an agreement where Tibet will be seperated into outer Tibet (modern day Tibet) ruled by the Dalai Lama and inner tibet (parts of present day sichuan and qinghai) where the religous aspect will be ruled by the Dalai Lama.  Unlike Mongolia with the russians, the nationalist party never signed the agreement.  Tibet as well as other provinces enjoyed de facto independence when the Chinese nation was torn by warlordism, Japanese invasion, and civil war (1911-1949).  However the nationalist still maintain sovereignty over Tibet.  Through the Succession of states theory in international law (Yuan, Ming, Qing, ROC, PRC)Tibet is still part of China and is now legally a province of China just like Xin Jiang and Inner mongolia.

This definition is completely neutral.Disclaimer: Just kidding.Tibia is one hell of a game to say the least. I got as high as lvl 24 before I finally quit. I recently took a look at it again. Then quit 45 minutes after reinstalling. Lets throw some facts out about tibia:1) Tibia is from some german university students, and they dont give a fuck about YOU.2) The \"US\" servers have successfully been hijacked by south american players, so learn portugese today. 3) You can play on different country servers, but since it lags on \"US\" servers, be prepared for 5 second click delays and lag deaths.4) Even the new anti-PK measures are shit, so your going to get hours of work training deleted by high levels everyday.5) The last topic is about the disgusting community around tibia.So lets analyze. In #1 we talked about the creators. They really just want tibia for a quick buck, and thats what its been like. And now they are a big company who still don't give a fuck about you. In #2 we talked about the take over. The north american servers are 90% portugese/spanish so if you dont know those, your going to get raped. Its funny I find mostly englsih speakers in pay-to-play games and thenf ree games are totally packed with barbarians- i mean brazilians. On to #3, it was self explanatory. #4 I talked a little about the PK problem. The time it takes to hunt in the high levels is completely insane. You really need to be unemployed and have a premium account to play after lvl 30. For #5 we have the community. So let me explain. You have 4 types of players: The Otakus, The Hardcore, The Newbies, and The Cheaters. See their traits below, maybe see which you are.The OtakusThese are socially rejected scum who live at their parents. They have come to tibia to find some friends. They generally play 16 hours a day. They spend most of their time chatting, hunting, and basically trying to make them selves seem respectable. The HardcoreThis group s like the otaku except they may have a part time job and their own place. They put all their spare time into tibia, often getting close to 16 hours (at least on weekends and holidays). If you are a lower level, they don't give a shit about you so its best to try and let them have what they want before they send you back a few days of work. The NewbiesThis caste generally consists of south americans who cant figure out the game much past hitting monsters and basic swear words. These players are found spamming sell and trade. If you have money they are your friend, if you dont, they are swearing at you and saying \"Jajaja\". Luckily the Otakus get stuck helping them out.The CheatersChances are you absoultely hate cheaters. But if you think about it, why not cheat (in a MMORPG)? Who is smarter? The guy with no life playing 16 hours a day, or the guy using a program to play the game 16 hours a day? Often cheaters are normal people who would rather watch a movie then grind on monsters. The social awareness of cheaters help keep the game from falling apart. All in all, there are much better games out there. Tibia will kill your dad and rape your mom.", "example" : "Cheating: Tibia has several hacks, the main ones are light hacks (to see in caves and at night), multi-client hacks, and other assortments of hacks. 99% contain trojans so there is little need to worry about being outdone by cheaters.", "word" : "tibia"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibiad"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibiae"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibial"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibiale"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibialia"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibialis"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibias"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibicen"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibicinist"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibiocalcanean"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibiofemoral"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibiofibula"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibiofibular"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibiometatarsal"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibionavicular"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibiopopliteal"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibioscaphoid"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibiotarsal"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibiotarsi"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibiotarsus"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibiotarsusi"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibouchina"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tibourbou"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tyburn"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tyburnian"},{"definition" : "Literally in Spanish = \"shark.\"  Used to refer to a player, a major man whore.", "example" : "Mami, avoid that tiburon; he brings nothing but a heartache.", "word" : "tiburon"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tiburtine"},{"definition" : "The drug phencycledine, more commonly known as PCP or angel dust, in a powder form.

The key distinction of the term is that it denotes a particlar quality of breast: Most often, but not limited to small breasts but also denoting other qualities such as firmness, perkyness and a generally fun, playfull quality to the breast that endears the viewer to the breat in question. \"Titties\" are typically appreciated by men and women with equal esteem and enthusiasm in that most women want \"titties\" and most men desire \"titties\" - the underlying assumption here is that the are considered \"nice\" by the widest range of standards, be it cute little \"A\" cups or the outer limits of \"c\" cup territory, Titties are the cream of the crop. As a part of the English vernacular the term is widely used to describe women's breasts in general but it more specifically referes to smaller firm breasts. This distinction is made more clearly when placed in the context of other relevent slang for breasts, such as: Boobs (the most generic term for breasts in the North American cultural lexicon). Boobs tend to denote medium to larger breasts (B cup to D cup) with less emphasis on perkyness and firmness. Jugs are the exclusive domain of big breasts( Minimum of a Big \"C\" cup and up). \"Flapjacks\", \"Funbags\" etc. denote a poorer quality of breast and invariably a saggy one when used in the proper gramatical context.", "example" : "Jennifer removed her lacy bra, revealing the most delicious little titties and pert nipples I've ever seen.You could see her titties peeking through her shirt.The girls all raved about how perfect Jennifer Aniston's titties looked.", "word" : "titty"},{"definition" : "Female breasts.", "example" : "\"I'm heading down to the strip club to check out some tittie.\"", "word" : "tittie"},{"definition" : "The breasts of a male or female, can also be called: APPLESBALCONYBALLOONSBANGERSBAZONGASBAZOOMSBEAN BAGSBIG BROWN EYESBON-BONSBOOBIESBOOBSBOTTLESBOULDERSBULLETSBUMPERSBUSTERSBUTTERBAGSCANTELOUPESGAZONGASGLANDSGLOBESGRAPEFRUITSGUAVASHANDFULHAND-WARMERSHEADERSHEADUGHTSHILLSHONKERSHOOTERSHOWITZERSJABOOSJIBSJUGSJUMBOSKAZONGASKNOBSKNOCKERSLACTOIDSLOAVESLOBLOLLIESLOVE BUBBLESLOVE MUFFINSLULUSLUNGSMAMMETSMAMSMANGOESMEATBALLSMEAT LOAVESMELONSMILK CANSMILK SHOPMOUNDSMOUNT OF ULIESMOUNTAINSMUFFINSMULLIGANSMURPHIESNANCIESNATURE'S FONTSNIBLETSNINNIESNIPPERSNODULESNOOGIESNUBBIESNUTSORANGESORBSOTTOMANSPAIRPALOOKASPAPAYASPAPSPEACHESPEAKSPEARSPECTSPEEPERSPILLOWSPIPSPOKERSPONTOONSPOTATOESPUMPKINSPUMPSRIB CUSHIONSROUNDIESSANDBAGSSCONESSCOOPSSETSHAKERSSHIMMIESSKIN SACKSSNUGGLE PUPSSPHERESSPUDSSTACKSSTUFFINGSWEATER MEATSWEET ROLLSSWINGERSTAMALESTETONSTIDBITSTITSTITTERSTI=IESTOMATOESTOOTERSTORPEDOESTWANGERSTWIN PEAKSTWOFERSUMLAUTSUPPER DECKWALDOSWARHEADSWARTSWATERMELONSWHOPPERSWOBBLERSWONGASYABBOSYAMSZEPPELINS", "example" : "Dude, those zepplins are fucking huge!", "word" : "titties"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tittymouse"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tittivate"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tittivated"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tittivating"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tittivation"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tittivator"},{"definition" : "The dot above the letter \"i\".", "example" : "Proof read your paper for missing tittles.", "word" : "tittle"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tittlebat"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "tittler"},{"definition" : "Little titties.

This serves to obliterate the feaures of the \"girl townies\" and cleverly hide the fact that the male and female of the species are almost indistinguishable without aids to appearance.Interpersonal relationships among their own groups are often primitive, centred around cheap sexual conquests and who is going to \"batter\" who. The two are often linked.The activities displayed by townies often serve to demonstrate a deep-seated aggression, often causing behaviour associated with extreme aggressiveness and violence. This includes a tendency to veer towards a non-towny in the street and \"start on\" them, at the same time accusing the aforementioned non-towny of doing the same to them. This is often accompanied by swearing, usually \"Come on then, you f**king c**t!\" or similar aggressive twaddle.Townies generally have no knowledge of how their sub-culture started, as despite their apparent embracing of black culture, they are usually more likely to take part in a racist assault than normal people like you or I. In fact, any group assault is likely to have townies at the root of the problem.I hope you have enjoyed reading my definition.

If female, the jogging jacket will most likely be pink or baby blue, most likely purchased for £5 at the local market and will have the word 'PRINCESS', 'BABE', 'BLING BLING' or 'FCUK' spelt out in white across the front.If male, the townie's jogging top will most likely be white with blue sleeves, again purchased for £5 at a market; and will have the name of an American city spelt out across the front, ie. 'BOSTON', 'DETROIT', or 'CUBA';   ..despite the fact that these creatures are not intelligent enough to know where the places they advertise on their chests are. Most, upon asking, will not even realize that 'BOSTON' is a city.A townie will often smoke because \"it's alrigh', innit?\". All townies own at least one item of clothing with the disgusting beige/brown Burberry print upon it. Obviously, this garment is not genuine Burberry, and instead of the £400 charged for a real Burberry bag/scarf, will have been purchased for £1.50 down the local market.A female townie will have poorly dyed blonde hair with split ends and two inch long roots, gelled back into an impossibly tight bun/ponytail held by a fake Burberry hair-tie. The ears will also be adorned with at least three fake gold earrings (\"only two quid fer eigh' pairs dahwn 'a marke'\") and will have some form of acne, vainly covered up by layers upon layers of cheap foundation, blue eyeshadow and neon blusher.

Hence the Trabi was born with a 26-hp, air-cooled, two-cycle engine and a body made out of a cellulose composite (not metal!) rendering it a bit unsafe in crashes. The car is very simple: the gas tank is at the highest point under the hood, and the fuel is gravity-fed to the carburator (no fuel pump), the engine is air-cooled (no need for radiator, antifreeze or waterpump), and it has a direct ignition system (no need for distributor cap/rotor, etc.). The inside is very cramped and its dashboard has a profound simplicity: a speedometer, a digital vacuum gauge and a few switches. Max speed is 60 mph (more than enough for the bad roads in E Europe). Some of the trickier things about running one are adding oil to the fuel manually (like the old lawnmowers). The car also has a cute dipstick with liter-marks that one can dip in the gas tank to see how much gas there is, since there is no fuel gage. The gravity-fed fuel line has a manual shut-off that one has to use after parking not to flood the enginge. The shifter is a column-mounted, L-shaped, 4 speed thing with a black plastic handle.

Quite hypocritical really.Typical trendy guys dress in denim, commonly wearing tight jeans. The jeans are usually long enough to overflow over a trendy's well-maintained trainers, just over the trainer's tongue. They usually wear short sleeve t-shirts of top names such as FCUK, and may wear a jacket (commonly denim). Trendy guys' hair are styled with gel, and they commonly decorate themselves with moderate amounts of jewerery (not too much bling).Trendy girls are easier to recognise. They are 'shopaholics', and therefore wear the lastest top fashion clothes. They are notoriously known for tight-fitting jeans bearing words such as 'hooch' or 'angel' at the rear. Belly buttons are exposed in fine weather (usually pierced) by their wearing of small tops. Hair styles range (and change) from different styles, but are always kept feminine. Make-up is usually worn in vast amounts, particuarly eye shadow and blusher. Fake tan is also popular.The view shared by other groups is that trendies are simply 'wannabe townies'. This is wrong. Trendies are a separate social group from townies and the two can be defined differently. Basically it depends on the person themselves and their behaviour towards people, and attitudes.
