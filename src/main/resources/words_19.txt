They simply defy categorization, but if I were to attempt to label them, it would be something along the lines of prog-death/sludge, but that's pretty insufficient. The band draws inspiration from lots of different bands, so to truly understand Mastodon, you must hear Mastodon.Their latest release, Leviathan, is a concept album that doesn't suck, which is worthy of praise for this alone. It's based on the story of Moby Dick. The band never sounds confined to the story, as thematic elements of the novel are addressed without summarizing the novel. This release is remarkably ambient, unlike their previous full-length, Remission. Every track is different and the CD may take a few listens to fully appreciate all that the band has to offer. The musicianship is top-notch; although the guitarist and the bassist (also vocalist) are completely proficient, the drummer steals the show. He's a master on the skins, providing some of the most exciting fills that perfectly fit the song. His excellence never comes off as 'showy', and at times, some of the more simpler stuff he plays is the most impressive.In addition to the aforementioned full-length release Remission, Mastodon has an earlier LP, Lifesblood.", "example" : "If you don't appreciate Mastodon, you're either a faggot, an indie kid, or a kvlt kiddie.

Techniques may also differ between males who have been circumcised and those who have not. Some techniques which may work for one individual can be difficult or uncomfortable for another.\n\nThe most common male masturbation technique is simply to hold the penis with a loose fist and then to move the hand up and down the shaft. This type of stimulation is typically all that is required to achieve orgasm and ejaculation. The speed of the hand motion will vary from person to person, although it is not uncommon for the speed to increase as ejaculation nears and for it to decrease during the ejaculation itself.", "example" : "It was gym class, and our gym teacher, a midriff baring coach named Jamie, wanted us to do some masturbation exercises. We all took off our clothes, including me. As we lied down on the gym floor naked, my penis began to relax, sway back and forth, and stiffen. Until finally, it got a powerful erection sticking straight up. Then, Jamie handed us some small balls to balance on our penises, similar to a sea lion balancing a beach ball on its snout. Then, Jamie stated to count down from ten to zero. Once she reached zero, she blew her whistle and my penis threw back its head, released the ball, and I began masturbating it. It felt so good. I gritted my teeth as Jamie continued blowing her whistle at me. My penis became coated with precum. The more Jamie blew her whistle, the more harder I masturbated. I started feeling my orgasm build up with every second. My member felt swollen and heavy as his load built up in the head. The other naked boys gathered around Coach Jamie as I finally let out a deep moan like a sea lion. And my hard-on ejaculated a flow of hot white semen that splashed against the floor. My penis bobbed up and down as a few more spurts of semen shot out, then slumped down into my lap. Then, the class cheered and Jamie blew her whistle as I opened my eyes and looked around.

In Rugby, A maul is formed if the ball carrier is held up and one player from each side binds onto him and tries either to rip the ball away or push him forwards. Once a maul has formed other players may join in but, as in a ruck, they must do so from their own side. If the maul stops moving forward, and the ball is not available to be played, then the referee awards a scrum to the side not in possession when the maul began. The tactic of the rolling maul occurs when mauls are set up, and the ball is passed backwards through the players hands to one at the rear, who rolls off the side to create a new maul. This tactic can be extremely effective in gaining ground and takes great skill and technique to both do properly and to try to prevent. It's a tactic most commonly used when the attacking side is inside their opponents' 22. It is illegal, on safety grounds, to pull down a maul, so that players fall to the ground. Referees are aware that many sides will try to stop a maul by deliberately collapsing it and will watch carefully for this illegal tactic.On the other hand, a maul is not properly formed if the ball carrier binds on to a team-mate from the rear, and both of them then drive into one or more opponents. The player in front is either accidentally or deliberately offside and the referee would award either a scrum or a penalty to the opposing side, depending on whether the infringement was viewed as accidental or deliberate. The tactic is sometimes referred to by players, commentators and referees by the colloquial term \"truck and trailer\"5. In Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace:Born 54 BBY, Darth Maul was the first known apprentice of Darth Sidious. A Zabrak originally from Iridonia, Maul had no memories of his homeworld or family, having been kidnapped as an infant by Sidious.Indoctrinated in the ways of the dark side from youth, Maul had no emotion aside from bloodlust and rage. During his training, any show of fear was severely punished by Sidious and any hint of mercy rewarded with cruelty. By the time Maul was an adolescent, his master had already forged him into a weapon of pure hatred. Marked by Sith tattoos that covered his entire muscular body, the young Zabrak was now the ultimate tool of the dark side. Despite this rather traumatic childhood (if it could be called that), Maul adored his Master, and never once contemplated killing him \u2014 until his final test.Sidious abandoned Maul on an isolated Outer Rim world, forcing him to survive alone while being hunted by hordes of assassin droids. After a month's time, his master returned and challenged his apprentice to a duel, one which Maul quickly lost. Sidious then told Maul that he had failed and he had been secretly training a replacement for him. Rage and hatred overwhelmed Maul and in one final act of defiance, he nearly defeated his master. When Maul's emotions were finally spent, he prepared himself for death, yet his master laughed instead. By wanting to kill his own master, Maul had in fact passed the final test. His master proclaimed him Darth Maul, Dark Lord of the Sith and took him to a new home on Coruscant. Unlike Sidious' later apprentices, Tyranus and Vader, Maul had no ambition to strike down his master. Also, unlike Tyranus and Vader, Sidious used him more as a tool than as an apprentice; he had no cunning, merely an unfailing devotion to his master. However, he did realize that Sith tradition required the death of his master before he could acquire an apprentice of his own.Maul was skilled with the lightsaber. According to Star Wars Insider #62, Darth Maul was trained by Darth Sidious to be a master of Form VII, which draws on emotions and the dark side. Unlike the traditional dueling techniques of most Jedi, Maul combined his swordsmanship with incredible acrobatic and martial arts and hand-to-hand combat skills, making him a nearly unstoppable dervish of destruction. Maul was a master of the fighting style ter√§s k√§si as well as an adept in the Jar'Kai style of wielding a lightsaber in each hand. When fighting multiple opponents, Maul extended the second blade of his double-bladed lightsaber to form a saberstaff, doubling his lethality. Maul often used this to catch opponents by surprise as few were prepared for the extra blade. Maul had constructed this weapon himself, using ancient plans stored within one of the Sith Holocrons the Sith still possessed. He had based his lightsaber design upon Exar Kun's.Maul was skilled with combining Force talents with mechanics. His master gave Maul the funds and schematics he needed and provided him with a secret facility on Coruscant in which to work. There, Maul constructed his signature speeder bike Bloodfin and his Dark Eye probe droids. Maul had a powerful transport\u2014a Sith Infiltrator called Scimitar, which hosted a cloaking shield generator. This vehicle was developed by Raith Sienar, the man whose company would later develop the TIE fighter for the Galactic Empire.Maul originally went on countless missions of terror for his master, killing politicians, crime bosses, merchants and warlords. Maul's very appearance had been carefully conceived to put fear into the heart of the Sith's enemies and unwitting allies. His victims included Neimoidian Hath Monchar, the Black Sun leader Alexi Garyn, the Nightsister Mighella and all of the Black Sun vigos and their bodyguards. Yet despite his untold successes, Maul longed for victory over the Jedi.During the events of Episode I: the Phantom Menace, Maul was sent to capture Queen Amidala and eliminate the two Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had been dispatched by the Galactic Republic to settle the conflict and protect the queen. Maul just barely failed in this task on Tatooine and he thirsted for revenge. Fighting Tusken Raiders and Togorian pirates put a drain on him by the time he left Tatooine.Upon arriving on Naboo, the hatred-fueled Sith warrior went straight at the two Jedi, ignoring the queen and allowing her to escape. In a vicious duel during the Battle of Naboo, Maul was remarkably able to fend off both of his Jedi opponents with the help of his double-bladed lightsaber. Maul then finally succeeded in slaying Jinn. However, overconfidence, a common personality trait among the Zabrak species, led to Maul's own immediate downfall when he challenged Obi-Wan. The young Padawan, enraged at his master's death, struck out at Maul with a furious assault of lightsaber swipes but by doing this, he put himself at great risk. Maul eventually Force pushed the vengeful Obi-Wan into a pit. He taunted the Padawan, who dangled helplessly by a ledge, watching his lightsaber fall down into the abyss. But by calming his anger over Jinn's death and connecting with the Force, Kenobi was able to make a spectacular leap out of the shaft and Force-guide Jinn's lightsaber into his own hands. Wasting no time in striking as he landed from his jump, Obi-Wan quickly sliced the astounded Maul in two before he could react. Maul barely had time to grimace as his body tumbled down the shaft in two pieces.Darth Maul first appeared in The Phantom Menace, but, to the disappointment of many fans, his character was killed by the end of the film. Maul's striking visual design, in addition to his limited role, have left many fans wanting to know more about his character.According to IMDb, \u201c...Though curious Star Wars fanatics clamored to rumors that Ray Park would return as Darth Maul in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002), their many speculations were shot down by George Lucas himself with the announcement that although that specific character would not return for the sequel, Park would indeed play a role in Episode II...\u201d What this role was remains a mystery.Maul's earlier escapades are documented in the following works:    * Jedi Council: Acts of War    * \"Darth Maul: Saboteur\"    * Darth Maul    * Episode I Adventures: The Fury of Darth Maul    * \"Marked\"    * Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter    * The Phantom Menace    * Episode I Journal: Darth MaulDarth Maul is also a secret character in the video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3.", "example" : "1.

A wave of mergers occurred in the 1980s due to the loosening of regulations by the Reagan administration. A similar boom occurred in the late 1990s, and, thus far, a wave of mergers in 2005 suggests that it will be another huge year of corporate combinations. Mergers create corporations with annoying, nonsensical names like \"AOL Time Warner,\" and \"JPMorganChase\" and \"PriceWaterHouseCoopers.\"  Frequently, corporations fail to realize any additional profit from these transactions, despite many workers losing their jobs due to the supposed \"efficiencies\" created.2. A transaction performed by the cockiest, least self-aware, obnoxious assholes in the worlds of investment banking and law.  The area of expertise in which one performs mergers is known as \"Mergers and Acquisitions\" or \"M&A.\"", "example" : "1.

Methamphetamine addiction is usually a hopeless condition, in that chronic abuse of the drug causes irrepairable brain and central nervous system damage, the former leading to lack of impulse control, extreme paranoia, extreme lack of empathy and reasoning power. This is due to the drug's destruction of the limbic system in the brain, a condition which seldom is reversible.  Most such addicts are extremely paranoid, exhibit flagrant dishonesty and are criminals in one way or another. Most methheads exhibit single-minded behavior (being \"stuck\"), usually devoted solely to getting their drug of choice, and will commit crimes against loved ones as easily as against strangers.  Self-loathing causes serious self-destructive behavior. Lack of sleep, poor nutrition and poor hygiene ages all methheads far beyond their years and life expectancy is short, usually caused by brain, renal and liver damage.  Also a hallmark of the addict is severe cystic acne and rotted teeth.  Once a methhead starts \"slamming\" their drug (using hypodermic syringes, usually .5 ml insulin types) they are generally hopeless, and even with long term rehabilitation, will relapse as bad as before or worse.  Sex drive among females becomes nil with heavy use, and they use sex as a weapon, lure or means of income, while males will exhibit an abnormal sexual drive for uncommon or taboo sexual acts, although the ability to get and retain an erection is lost.  Loved ones of methheads must learn to dissociate from their victimized friends and keep them away, as property theft is a favorite methhead occupation.  Use of expensive surveillance equipment is a must (if they even have a house) and crime to them becomes completely justifiable.  The recovery rate among methamphetamine addicts is around 20%; the other 80% remain menaces to society.  Almost all have criminal records.

The development of new technologies requires millwrights to work with new industry-specific and highly complex precision machines. Some of these machines have tolerances smaller than the width of a human hair.The millwright\u2019s responsibilities begin before a new piece of machinery arrives at the jobsite. Millwrights consult with production managers, industrial engineers, and others to determine the optimal placement of the machine in the plant. Some equipment, such as a metal forging press, is so heavy that it must be placed on a new foundation. Millwrights either prepare the foundation themselves or supervise its construction. As a result, they must know how to read blueprints and to work with a variety of building materials.When the new machine arrives, millwrights unload, inspect, and move the equipment into position. To lift and move light machinery, millwrights use rigging and hoisting devices, such as pulleys and cables. With heavier equipment, they may use hydraulic-lift trucks or cranes. Lifting such heavy equipment requires millwrights to understand the load properties of cables, ropes, hoists, and cranes. Parts of power plant turbines and other machinery can weigh more than 100 tons and must be precisely positioned; even nuts and bolts can weigh a few hundred pounds each and require a crane to move.Next, millwrights assemble the machinery. They fit bearings, align gears and wheels, attach motors, and connect belts, according to the manufacturer\u2019s blueprints and drawings. Precision leveling and alignment are important in the assembly process, so millwrights measure angles, material thickness, and small distances with calipers, squares, micrometers, and other tools. When a high level of precision is required, they use devices such as lasers and ultrasonic measuring and alignment tools. Millwrights also work with hand and power tools, such as cutting torches, welding machines, hydraulic torque wrenches, hydraulic stud tensioners, soldering guns, and with metalworking equipment, including lathes and grinding machines.In addition to installing and dismantling machinery, many millwrights work with industrial mechanics and maintenance workers to repair and maintain equipment. This includes preventive maintenance, such as lubrication and fixing or replacing worn parts. If a spare part is unavailable, a millwright may use a lathe or other machine tool to cut a new part.Increasingly sophisticated automation means more complicated machines for millwrights to install and maintain, requiring millwrights to specialize in certain machines or machine brands. For example, some millwrights specialize in installing and maintaining turbines in power plants that can weigh hundreds of tons and contain thousands of parts. This machinery requires special care and knowledge, so millwrights receive additional training and are required to be certified by the turbine manufacturer.Millwrights in manufacturing often work in a machine shop and use protective equipment, such as safety belts, protective glasses, and hardhats, to avoid injuries from falling objects or machinery. Those employed in construction may work outdoors in difficult weather conditions.Millwrights at construction sites may travel long distances to worksites. For example, millwrights who specialize in turbine installation travel to wherever new power plants are being built.Advanced equipment, such as hydraulic wrenches and hydraulic stud tensioners, have made the work safer and eliminated the need for millwrights to use sledge hammers to pound bolts into position. Other equipment has reduced the strenuous tasks that caused injuries in the past.Millwrights work independently or as part of a team. Because disabled machinery costs time and money, many millwrights work overtime and some work in shifts; about 39 percent of millwrights report working more than 40 hours during a typical week. During power outages or other emergencies, millwrights often work overtime.Median hourly wage-and-salary earnings of millwrights were $21.94 in May 2006. The middle 50 percent earned between $17.13 and $29.42. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $13.84, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $34.39. Earnings vary by industry and geographic location. Median hourly wage-and-salary earnings in the industries employing the largest numbers of millwrights were:Pulp, paper, and paperboard mills \t$25.43Iron and steel mills and ferroalloy manufacturing \t20.91Nonresidential building construction \t20.34Building equipment contractors \t19.67Sawmills and wood preservation \t17.55About 50 percent of millwrights belong to labor unions, one of the highest rates of membership in the economy.
