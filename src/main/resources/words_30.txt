Though the Nissan Silvia has beginnings in the '70's, it didn't really pick up popularity until the 's' chassis reached 13, 14, and the most recent s15 chassis (s12's are now gaining some popularity, but the s13 is by far the most famous silvia chassis). Never released in the states, it became very popular in japan as the sport of drifting started taking off. The 2 wheel rear drive drivetrain and perfect weight to power balance made this car amazing for the sport!The Nissan Silvia came in three different trim levels starting in 1988 when the s13 chassis was released. These are the J's, Q's, and K's trims.J's was the base model, non turbo engine (ca18de from '88-'90 and sr20de from '91 and on) and lacked sunroof or power windows.Q's was the next step up, though still NA, this trim level brought power windows, HUD, and a sunroof into the pictureK's was the highest trim level, featuring a turbo engine (ca18det from '88-'90 and sr20det from '91 and up), and had power everything, like the Q's trim.The s14 brought with it another useless trim level which most, oddly enough, seem to be misinformed in thinking is greater then the K's...ALMIGHTY was the new trim level that the s14 chassis brought with it. It is much like the us Nissan 240sx LE trim level. It featured power everything, like the Q's and K's, and leather interior, which was new to the Silvia world. However, the ALMIGHTY trim lacked a turbo charged engine, and came with the non turbo sr20de.The Nissan Silvia s15 chassis brought along yet another new trim, abolishing the 'card suit' trim levels, it used standard trim, offering only a turbo charged sr20det. Also available was the new trim 'SpecV' which, like all SpecV Nissans, included a much desired six speed transmission.These Silvia chassis car were released in the states under the 200sx (S12 Silvia and Gazelle) and 240sx model names (The s13 240sx came in coupe or fastback variety in the states, the fastback was also released in Japan under the 180sx model name. It featured popup headlights just like in the states. The s13 coupe is the same as a Silvia with a 180sx front end) The s14 chassis was also released stateside. The s15 chassis, however, was released only in Japan, and later in Australia and parts of Europe with an engine equivalent to an s13 sr20det redtop for some reason.I HOPE I COVERED IT GOOD ENOUGH!!! lol", "example" : "\"Wow, that US 240sx looks teh sex with that s13 silvia front end on it!\"\"You're US 240sx coupe could use a JDM silvia front end, your Chuki 180sx front makes me gag.\"", "word" : "silvia"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "sylvia"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "sylvian"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "sylvic"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "silvical"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "sylvicolidae"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "sylvicoline"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "silvicolous"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "silvics"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "silvicultural"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "silviculturally"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "silviculture"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "sylviculture"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "silviculturist"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "sylviid"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "sylviidae"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "sylviinae"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "sylviine"},{"definition" : "A very ambitious brown skinned big juicy booty big headed braced face young lady who loves to have sex and eat pizza and LOVE honeybuns.

Intelligent and resolute, he does exceptionably well in school, on projects and homework. Being intuitive, Skanda has a myriad of innovative ideas that will one day end up changing the world in some way or another. Although he is a little cluttered, he manages to keep track of the consequential things, for the most part. Most Skandas make references to shows and movies, when it is needed. Sometimes, he has a sarcastic attitude. Skanda becomes worried, easily, and always has the best intentions. You wish you could spend all your time with him. One kiss will leave you in a dream state for a week or two. Skanda has the power to make you feel a multitude of emotions. One moment, you can be crying and the next, you can be chuckling. He always knows what to say at the perfect moment. You can tell him anything and he will give you a consummate answer from the heart. His friends, sometimes, have debates with him.

Q: Why would fresh fruit cause the skitters?A: Well, the juices found in fresh fruit contain sorbitol, which is a nondigestible kind of sugar.

For example, you don't want to pull out your butterfly net and try to catch butterflies in the car you are getting a ride in. Farting and really bad breath are not recommended, but bathing is, and not with garlic soap. Picking your nose and wipping your buggers on the seats is frowned upon. Screaming at the driver or other drivers, that he is a facist, polluter, WASP, pig and other name calling is also not recommended, and discouraged by other slugs. In fact it is best to keep the conversation on the lite side. This does not mean ethnic or gender, sex orientation jokes, especially ones that are offensive and rude. Cussing is frowned upon. It is recommended that you do not adjust the radio or steal the persons cd's no matter how much you like their music. When coughing it is best not to wipe one's hands on the seat or door handle. It is best not to go slugging to work after a long night of drinking especially if you vomit on these occassions. Most people slugging have said that they have not had good luck getting rides from people after picking their sores and talking about their recent contagious disease relapses. It is good not to ask personal questions like could you sit on my hand or ask them about their young kids and tell them how much you enjoy kids. But that you cannot have them because you are a sex offender.If you are a cutter and bleeder don't do this when slugging.No matter how tempting and inspired you are it is good to think about your compliments. A white guy telling a black man that he never thought he'd be driven around town by a black man in a caddy, is about is nice as a black guy telling a white guy he never in his wildest dreams thought he'd have a white driver in some fancy car driving him around town for free.No matter how tempting it is slugs don't steal the persons jewelry, GPS, or any other easy to reach item. Nor do they rob the person at gun or knife point or even demand sex of any kind. Slugging is more of an art than a science. Much of the art is in being wonderful and being as pleasant as possible without breaking into John Denver or the Carpenters song catalog, no matter how well sing out of key or how you do it to make them happy by doing so.", "example" : "I have been slugging to work for years.

It often includes such topics as the nature and extent of the atonement as well as the entire process of salvation, conceived as an eternal, divine plan designed to rescue lost and erring sinners and bring them back into eternal fellowship with God. Many regard it as the primary theme in Scripture with the glory of God as its goal.", "example" : "Throughout the history of the church a number of different views regarding the nature of the atonement (i.e., the theological significance of Christ\u2019s death) have been advanced. The Recapitulation view was advanced by Irenaeus (ca. 120-ca. 200). In this view Christ sums up all humanity in himself in that he went through all the stages of human life, without succumbing to temptation in any way, died, and then rose from the dead. The benefits of his life, death, and resurrection are then available to all who participate in Him through faith. The Example or Moral Influence (or \u201csubjective\u201d) view has been advanced by theologians such as Pelagius (ca. 400), Faustus and Laelius Socinus (sixteenth century), and Abelard (1079-114233). Though there are certainly different moral example views,34 their essential agreement consists in arguing that the cross demonstrates how much God loves us and this, then, awakens a response of love in our hearts; we then live as Jesus himself lived. While there is biblical support for this idea (e.g., Phil 2: 6-11; 1 Pet 2:21), it is incomplete as it stands and fails to recognize the more crucial aspects of scriptural teaching on the issue. Another theory of the atonement advanced in the early church\u2014and really maintained as the standard view in the early church until Anselm\u2014is the Ransom to Satan view. Origen (185-254) was one of the chief proponents of this understanding which asserts that Christ\u2019s death was a ransom paid to Satan to secure the release of his hostages, i.e., sinful men and women. While ransom language is used in Scripture to refer to the atonement (e.g., Mark 10:45), it is probably incorrect to include in this the idea that a \u201cprice\u201d was paid to Satan, for nowhere in Scripture is such an idea suggested. In his work Christus Victor, the Swedish theologian Gustav Aulén (1879-1977) argued for a Divine Triumph or Dramatic view of the atonement, similar to the ransom theories of Origen and the early church. In the dramatic view God overcame all the powers of hell and death through the cross and in doing so made visible his reconciling love to men. This too has some biblical support, but it is unlikely that it adequately summarizes all of scriptural revelation on this issue.The Satisfaction or Commercial view of Anselm (1033-1109) argues that man has dishonored God by his sin and that through the death of the perfect, sinless God-man, Jesus Christ, that honor and more\u2014including Satan\u2019s defeat\u2014has been restored to God. This theory also finds support in scripture, but more than God\u2019s honor was restored through the death of his son. The Governmental view of the atonement, advanced by Hugo Grotius (1583-1645), places a high value on the justice of God and the demand of his holy law. In this view, the death of Christ upholds God\u2019s moral government in that it demonstrates His utter commitment to His holy law. He could have forgiven men, however, without the death of Christ, but this would have left men without the true knowledge of His commitment to His Law. The death of Christ, then, is not as a substitute for us, but rather God\u2019s statement about what he thinks about his moral government of the universe. This view has much to commend it, but as a global theory it simply cannot account for the tight connection between three important facts in Scripture: (1) the reconciliation of the believing sinner; (2) the forgiveness of sin; and (3) the death of Christ. Peter says that \u201cChrist died for sins, once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring us to God\u201d (1 Peter 3:18; cf. Rom 5:8). The Penal Substitution view of the atonement35\u2014the view most often associated with the Reformers, in particular, Calvin\u2014argues that Christ died in the sinner\u2019s place and appeased the wrath of God toward sin. Thus there are a cluster of ideas in this view including redemption (ransom), sacrifice, substitution, propitiation, and reconciliation, Though there are tensions in this view, and though the other views each contribute important insights to the idea of Christ\u2019s atonement in the NT, this one perhaps rests on the best scriptural support, and brings together the holiness and love of God, the nature and sacrifice of Christ, and the sinfulness of man in a way that all are properly maintained.

Speed is amphetamine, a stimulating drug that triggers the brain\u2019s reward system giving the user feelings of pleasure. Speed also goes by the street names \u201cIce, Crystal meth and Shabu\u201d 2 The drug works using Dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is used in all matters of the brain from learning to attentiveness. However, the most prominent usage of dopamine is to incite the brain\u2019s reward system. Dopamine is released in the brain naturally when people eat, drink and have sex. 1 Dopamine is released into the synaptic space in between the pre and postsynaptic neurons. Here is where speed comes in. Speed\u2019s goal (Speed doesn\u2019t really have a goal it merely exists, but this is the reason people use it) is to trigger a buildup of Dopamine. Speed first enters the Terminal Button in one of several ways. Speed is very similar on a molecular level to Dopamine so Speed can enter the Dopamine transporter or speed can diffuse into the neuron. The amphetamine then expels the dopamine out into the synaptic space. It does this through a process that forces the Dopamine transporters to go in reverse. Under natural circumstances Dopamine is brought back into the terminal button through the Dopamine reuptake pumps. These pumps do not work as well when speed is present in the brain and the Dopamine remains longer as a result. \u201cSpeed also inhibits monoamine oxydase A (MAO-A).\u201d1 Speed also forces glutamate to come into the synaptic space. The result of this is dopamine will flow more easily. \tThe effects people notice with amphetamines make it clear why the drug has earned the name speed. Speed makes everything go faster.
