It is rock based music that pushed boundaries beyond  pop 'single' verse, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, four minute compositions. Prog encompasses various styles dating back to the late 60s depending on influences and established music forms being blended together. Classical blended with rock is a style of prog called 'symphonic'. Jazz musicians that composed rock suites are called 'fusion' in the U.S.. In the U.K. jazz and rock combine in the style called 'canterbury'. In France it's called 'zuehl'. Freakout, jam style bands in Germany are called 'krautrock'; elsewhere they are called 'spacerock' and 'jambands'. Bands whos sound is dominated by synthesizers as both rhythm and lead instruments are called 'electronic'. There are many progressive style rock artists who are unclassifiable, who pushed the boundaries of rock in the late 60s and early 70s in completely unique ways such as Funkadelic, Frank Zappa and the early Santana band. Prog is a nebulous term applied to artists who play rock instrumentation without regard to commercial, pop radio format restraints of song length and/or improvisational content. Some examples of 70s prog artists beside those already mentioned are Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Soft Machine, Magma, Embryo, Osibisa, Gong and Tangerine Dream.Some examples of prog in the new millenium are The Flower Kings, Kenso, Ozric Tentacles, Groove Collective,  Deus Ex Machina and Radio Massacre International.", "example" : "I'm going to the four day baja prog festival in mexicali.", "word" : "prog"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "progambling"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "progamete"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "progamic"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "proganosaur"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "proganosauria"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "progenerate"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "progeneration"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "progenerative"},{"definition" : "descendants of... or successors of...", "example" : "Mariano Gimenez Pardo & his progeny from Spain & the Philippines.", "word" : "progeny"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "progenies"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "progenital"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "progenity"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "progenitive"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "progenitiveness"},{"definition" : "A colossal dinosaur creature much like Godzilla that stomps on cities, then furiously mates with the nearest tallest structure.

Though prolapse in adult film was originally seen as obscene or accidental in recent years it has become an increasingly popular act combined with internal ejaculation and extreme penetrations.  Models with loose or prolapse-able vaginas are hired for the sole purpose of showcasing their abilities on camera.  Sometimes to shocking and disturbing results.Medical side effects include the inability to retain urine, feces as well as the inability to contain internal (vaginal or rectal) tissue inside the body during intercourse.  Women who repeatedly force the prolapse of their vagina increase the likelyhood of being unable to keep the insides of their vaginas from bulging out or in some cases hanging between their legs as the connective tissues and tendons can be strained and even broken.

More than 4.5 million adults in the United States have it. It generally appears as patches of raised red skin covered by a flaky white buildup. In certain kinds of psoriasis, it also has a pimple-ish (pustular psoriasis) or burned (erythrodermic) appearance.

It is these intense desires that are at the heart of the quickie.In addition to being a great way to injecting passion back into your relationship, quickies are a handy time-management tool in a busy life. There may be day-to-day commitments that prevent you from having sex as often as you use to. Or, maybe at the end of the day, you or your partner are just too tired from working and looking after the kids to get involved in an hour-long lovemaking session. A quickie is a great way to still get some sexual satisfaction, without having to devote too much time or energy!Now, while quickies are a great way to get pleasure and keep the fire of love alive, it is not advised to ONLY have quickies. A loving, healthy relationship demands balance. Having an occasional quickie can demonstrate there is still passion in the relationship. However, making love (the romantic kind!) and taking the time to satisfy and thoroughly enjoy each other, is necessary for strengthening intimacy. Just as long as it is mutually agreed upon (i.e. both of you know in advance that it\u2019s going to be short and sweet), quickies are great way to reconnect with one another and are a great solution to trying to schedule sex around hectic lifestyles. There\u2019s nothing wrong (or selfish!) with wanting a brief and exciting break and then getting back to the dishes, paying bills or whatever you were in the middle of doing!\"I was sitting in my study chair with CALCULUS 301 on my mind.

The term \"raggy\" is generally limited to someone between the ages of 12-25, past the age of 25 it is widely agreed the raggy graduates to being white trash A typical raggy can be found riding their stolen black spray painted BMX bike in the downtown areas of Winsted and surrounding micropolises (Torrington also being a raggy hotspot).   The characteristics of a raggy are constant from each offender. Your standard raggy can be found wearing an 80s metal t-shirt, or the latest t-shirt from hot topic displaying an ironic slogan on the front. Along with their nonexistent sense of style, raggies can generally be found with hair that has been uncut for the better part of a year, and sporting spotty facial hair that badly needs to be shaved (see rat stache).  A raggies hygiene seems to be almost nonexistent; it is not a stretch to say that raggies do not bathe for days, if not weeks, at a time.  A raggies home life can be described as turbulent at best. Amateur sociologist\u2019s research has concluded that the raggy bloodline generally extends through numerous generations, and the typical raggy stems from unloving alcoholic parents and succumb to this gruesome subculture as a way to get back at their guardians, unknowingly taking the paths that their parents took when they were youths.  Raggies have historically not taken well to the educational system, and surmised research has been conclusive in stating that the average dropout rate of a raggy is upwards of 67%.  This lack of education can effectively attribute to a raggies lack of income later in life. It seems that this high dropout rate goes hand in hand with a raggies lack of respect for authority, only creating more trouble for them in their devious path of life.
