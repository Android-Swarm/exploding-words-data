Current literature indicates that desperado is derived from the spanish term desesperado which means a person with no hope. The term comes from esperanza which means hope. Adding \u201cdes\u201d to the front makes it an antonym. Changing the ending \u201canza\u201d to \u201cado\u201d makes it an adjective and desesperado means a person with no hope.  While this may be logical, it intuitively does not seem to fit well. I sounds like an Ivy league researcher explanation.  I spoke with  Native American oral historian and their oral history says that the term evolved in this fashion: Spain created the Camino Real from Mexico to Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1598. Camino Real literally means \u201cRoyal Road\u201d. As such the road is protected by garrisons at intervals along the road.  Spanish law levied a toll to travelers on the Camino Real in order to pay for these soldiers.  The soldiers would stop the travelers and demand the toll be paid for them to continue on. In spanish \u201cto stop\u201d is \u201cparar\u201d.  And as above \u201cdesparado\u201d is a person that was not stopped. According to their oral history, the term desparado, described travelers that did not want to pay a toll and circled, off the road, around the military posts.  The term became associated with \u201cscofflaws\u201d, people that openly disrespect the law.  When the Americans immigrated into the area they modified the language of the region to suite. Words like \u201cla reata\u201d in Spanish became \u201clariat\u201d and desparado became desperado.  To me this explanation makes a better fit, desparado meaning law breaker is a better fit than desesperado a \u201ca person with no hope\u201d.", "example" : "Desperados have been depicted in Western literature and film for decades. The movie Desperado is about a cowboy character running from the law. Which is appropriate for a person that shot the sheriff.

If they regularly took niacin, the flush would lessen and lessen until eventually it stopped altogether. Hubbard concluded that the flush was radiation leaving the body, and that it stopped because all the radiation had been flushed out. Funnily enough, if you ask a medical professional, he'll tell you that a known side-effect of niacin overdoses is that they cause the cells in the body to release histamine, and that histamine can cause a strange red flush. He'll also tell you that when you're sunburnt, your capillaries - the tiny blood vessels in your skin become damaged, that when they heal they heal into a different structure than undamaged capillaries, and that in the event of a histamine release caused by overdoses of niacin, the red flush would look much different in areas with these damaged capillaries.

Yes, it's an actual word, but it both works in a literal sense and in a morphological sense. 'The action or process of distributing things or people over a wide area.' Dispersing one's emotional, social, and other relationship needs across multiple partners allows any one partner to avoid shouldering too much social burden.\n\nThe 'com' in 'compassion' is 'with.' The 'dis' in 'dispassion' is 'apart.' The compersion you feel, as a result of being able to get away from each other, is dispersion.\"", "example" : "Brad was feeling socially overstimulated when Jennifer wanted to spend every evening at home, but now Jennifer is also dating Angelina.
