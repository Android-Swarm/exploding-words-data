Cognac comes from the county of \"Cognac\" in France. If it's made in somewhere else, then it is not Cognac at all.It is being kept in oak barrels for many years where it will get better tasting and get's it red-brown color.Years in the barrel:2 - *****, VS, Sélection, de Luxe4 - VSOP, VO, Réserve, Vieux6 - Napoleon, XO, Extra, Royal, ImperialIf your cognac is 20 years old, it still might be XO for example.

Think monkey target but on a coffee table with coins of varying sizes instead of monkies and the target drawn on with pencils. From the humble beginings of \"this coin from the edge of that table onto this spot. Betcha can't! WAHEY 500 points!!!\" the game grew to \"we should have a restart line, overshoot divot and incrementaly splayed draw-decider\". Shots at target have developed from the simple 'lay-on-the-edge-and smack' through the 'flick', 'push' and 'slide' to the dizzy heights of the 'index bowl' the 'asp' and the 'whipcrack-slide'.

A bird tent as a place to sleep and hand out is usually eagerly accepted and treasured. As they like to climb under pillows and blankets, care needs to be taken not to accidentally smother them.\n\nThey make great birds for those who don't mind the occasional (or NOT so occasional) screeching outburst. This is something to be considered when thinking of adding a conure to your family. Conures can be VERY noisy and can also be nippy, if not trained and socialized properly. They do enjoy learning new tricks and can be very entertaining. They love to dance and can also be taught to go the toilet with a simple command such as \"toilet\" or \"poop\" .\n\nConures do require more time and effort than say a cockatiel or budgie. Please keep this in mind. Owners report that they are smart and interactive, but are also more prone to behavioral problems than are cockatiels or budgies - but this would be the case with any conure.

In basic trigonometry, it is used to determine unknown side lengths or an acute angle measurement(s).  In more advanced mathematics, cosine is treated simply as a function without an apparent or direct reference to a triangle (the triangle's presence becomes assumed).  Examples of this may be seen in Calculus through the process of integration.  Wherein, the function cosine may only be a part of a large equation.Cosine is one component out of a three-part acronym known as: SOHCAHTOA.  The term cosine occupies the \"CAH,\" wherein the series forms: Cosine (equals) Adjacent (over) Hypotenuse.Cosine thus represents the ratio of the Adjacent side length to the Hypotenuse side length -- this is all in relation to an (acute) angle, theta.When dealing with an angle measurement, x (\"theta\"), the side \"touching\" the angle is referred to as the Adjacent side; the side furthest away from the angle is referred to as the Opposite side; and, in a right triangle, the hypotenuse always remains and, simplistically, may be recognized as the diagonal side.In mathematical procedures, cosine is abbreviated as \"cos\" for convenience.Note: UrbanDictionary entries do not support Entity, Hex or Decimal browser rendering.  This definition replaces the Greek small letter, \"theta\", with an \"x.\"However, in reality, it appears as an \"o\" or a \"zero\" with a line going horizontally through the center.", "example" : "1.
