June 15th, 1989 an archeologist near Sparta Greece, unearthed some pottery with the descriptions of 3 new daughters of Zeus he secretly had with a Spartan woman. This mystery woman lost her husband at the famous Battle of Thermopylae having been a legendary 300. It's the greatest amount of children Zeus ever had with a mortal woman. The love between them ran deeper than any relationship a Greek god has ever had.Sir Charles Scott made the discovery and named the mystery woman after combining his late wife with the name of his late daughter's who were both tragically killed together in a car crash on their way to the airport to see him. He began using the mystery woman's name as a way to describe the \"true love\" he had with his wife, and the \"passionate\" eternal love Zeus shared also. On his death bed, Oct. 20th, 2008, Charles described the passion all 3 of these women had in common. He concluded saying, \"there is a divine LEIGH in every woman, and a true LEIGH is and only will be the kind of woman who can ever change the heart of a man, even a god.\"\n\nDEFINITIONS:1n.

The word leviathan has become synonymous with any large monster or creature. The Biblical Leviathan is often considered to be a demon associated with Satan or the Devil, and held by some to be the same monster as Rahab (Isaiah 51:9). The Biblical references to Leviathan appear to have evolved from a Canaanite legend involving a confrontation between Baal and a seven headed sea monster which Baal defeats with the aid of Mot, and they also resemble a Babylonian myth in which the storm god Marduk slays the sea monster Tiamat and creates the earth and sky from the two halves of her corpse. Leviathan may also be interpreted as the sea itself, with its counterpart, Behemoth, being the land. Certain Jewish legends consider Leviathan as an androgynous dragon that seduced Eve in his male form, and Adam in his female form. In demonology a Leviathan is every aquatic demon. They are great liars. Leviathans can also possess persons, being very difficult to exorcise; they try to possess every person, but especially women. The word has been reused (not only in literature) over and again: in the 1660 book Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes in the Illuminatus trilogy in Moby-Dick as a reference to the whale in the Final Fantasy games in the Farscape science fiction series (living spaceship) in the 1989 film Leviathan --------------------------------------------------------------------------------In Hebrew, leviathan also means a device for washing raw wool.", "example" : "\"Carefull with the laviathan!\"", "word" : "leviathan"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "leviathans"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "leviation"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levied"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levier"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "leviers"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levies"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levigable"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levigate"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levigated"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levigates"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levigating"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levigation"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levigator"},{"definition" : "To impose taxes", "example" : "My mom said i have to keep levying.Little bitch", "word" : "levying"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levyist"},{"definition" : "outre; a state of enlightened subconsciousness", "example" : "\"Yeah, man, it's totally levin.\"", "word" : "levin"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levyne"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "leviner"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levining"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levynite"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levins"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levir"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levirate"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levirates"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "leviratic"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "leviratical"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "leviration"},{"definition" : "the brand of pants that make ALOMST all guys ass's hotter", "example" : "hey, look at Austin wearing those levis, why is he hot? oh yeah, that's why!", "word" : "levis"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levisticum"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levitant"},{"definition" : "To raise up or leave.", "example" : "Me and my mans about to levitate - Mos Def", "word" : "levitate"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levitated"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levitates"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levitating"},{"definition" : "floating off the ground", "example" : "levitationlight as a feather, stiff as a board", "word" : "levitation"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levitational"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levitations"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levitative"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levitator"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levite"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "leviter"},{"definition" : "Inappropriate humor during matters of seriousness to lessen the dread of reality", "example" : "The Terminator said, \"Your levity is good, it relieves tension and the fear of death. \"", "word" : "levity"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levitical"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "leviticalism"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "leviticality"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levitically"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "leviticalness"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "leviticism"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "leviticus"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levities"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "levitism"},{"definition" : "Levo is an independent world that has resisted joining the revolution.

The city sits at the mouth of the Mersey estuary and is currently enjoying a resurgence in fortunes. Now for all those fools who have criticised Liverpool and her people in these definitions, I think its time to address some grievances. I know many of you'll not like what I have to say, but that\u2019s tough S**T. So without any more chatter lets begin...Accusation: Scousers are all thieves! Response: Liverpool has a lower crime rate then nearly all the major cities in Britain. Even taking population in to account, some notable cities which have higher crime rates include Manchester and London.Accusation: Liverpool has no culture!Response : The city of Liverpool has more listed buildings than anywhere in the Britain, with the exception of Westminster. This is due to the fact that Liverpool had the worlds largest port from the 19th century up until the 20th. This meant Liverpool was alive with travellers from around the world, all bridging their culture with them. Indeed Liverpool has the oldest Chinese community in Europe, dating back 800 years. Not only this but the area surrounding the famous Liver buildings is a unesco world heritage site.We have numerous art galleries, two amazing cathedrals, not to mention a great musical heritage. Many Scousers are also blessed with the ability to formulate a coherent argument explaining why idiots who insult our city are the quintessence of stupidity. Did I mention we have three universities, The university of Liverpool being responsible for coining the term red brick.Accusation: Liverpool is a shithole!Response: Ever since the second world war, when Liverpool was the second most bombed city outside of London (somebody thought we were important), the city had never recovered. Despite being the centre for Atlantic command and the most important port in the Empire, once the war was over we were left to get on with it. The damage to the city was immense and the city did not receive the investment it needed to recover. When coupled with the decline in shipping, the result was many people out of work living in poverty. During a time when you needed money to get ahead, education was not a top priority and standards fell. As time went by, and due to the ignorance of others, little investment made its way into the city and stereotypes began to form. The city went in to serious economic decline.However there is now renewed optimism and ever increasing investment in to the city, e.g. the £1 billion pound grovesner Paradise project. The city is not a shit hole, but its not perfect, nowhere is. But I would rather live here than London(filled with many rude people).Conclusion:Liverpool does have problems, it does have scum, thieves, and idiots but a lot less than some places I can think of. I am not going to criticise other cities because everywhere has its charms. The fact is that Liverpool people are very friendly, we put up with so much criticism that you learn to smile through it. Most Scousers don't hate Manchester by the way, just the idiots that criticise us. We are not racist, but Liverpool FC IS the most successful football club of all time.

The most important part of lombard is Sacred Heart School, located right on the corner of Elizabeth and Maple. The kids who attended this school rule all of Lombard. Everyone thinks they're punk skaters until the end of 8th grade and everyone plays park district soccer at least once. All you Lombard alums will remember Lombard Lanes, the glass bank, and the historical movie theater, all of which are town down now.

In many situations this is not available (prison , outdoors etc) and the user has to turn to something like a Lung to get the job done.Usually a lung is made from a plastic bottle 2lt or larger with the bottom cut off and a plastic bag taped taped to the bottom of the bottle in its place. If the bag is airtight it is pushed upwards inside the bottle and a head (13ml socket set + gauze) is placed into the top of the bottle then filled with whatever the user is smoking.The inflation of the lung is usually a co-operative process involving 2-3 people as the bottle needs to be held upright to stop the head from falling out while the bag is pulled from the bottom into an inflated position while a lighter is held over the top of the head to light the smoking material. The action of manually inflating the lung draws large amounts of air into the the plastic bottle filling the plastic bag. The smoker then has to remove the head (ouch its hot >.< ) and attempt to suck the entire contents of the bag into their lungs. (though it can be operated by a single person by attaching the bottom of the bag to the floor or by standing on it)Because of the the amount of smoke inside the bag is very large the user has to breath in very deeply to empty the bag in one go. This has the added effect of drawing smoke into parts of the lungs that normal smoking doesnt necessarily reach which results in a much higher level of THC absorption that a user is may be used to. Also the deep breathing can cause a certain amount of hyperventilation raising the users blood pressure making them somewhat dizzy. Put those together with the fact that most people using a lung are 'smoking noobs' and have a very low tolerance to THC in the first place the end result is usually an extremely potent high.I have no idea what breathing the burning plastic made by the hot ashes from the head hitting the inside of the plastic bag as its inflated does to your lungs O_o.", "example" : "\"but there's no water for the bong dude..\"\"Fuck it! well have to make a lung instead i guess\"\"what with?\"\"A plastic bag, some tape and...the bong....\"\"Fuck you asshole!! your not cutting the bottom off my bong!\"\"well how else we gonna get fucked up Einstein?\"\".....fuck it!

Under ITS, when you first walked up to a terminal at MIT and typed Control-Z to get the computer's attention, it printed out some status information, including how many people were already using the computer; it might print \"14 users\", for example. Someone thought it would be a great joke to patch the system to print \"14 losers\" instead. There ensued a great controversy, as some of the users didn't particularly want to be called losers to their faces every time they used the computer. For a while several hackers struggled covertly, each changing the message behind the back of the others; any time you logged into the computer it was even money whether it would say \"users\" or \"losers\". Finally, someone tried the compromise \"lusers\", and it stuck. Later one of the ITS machines supported luser as a request-for-help command.

Of course if you have the time to read through all of them you realise that these 10 features or reasons have been standard with the PC a long, long, long time. Some of the reasons are just plain myths that Apple invented. Probably because they ran out of fabricated facts.So take the journey through the 10 commandments of a mac-enthusiast and enjoy their naive attitude towards personal computing.1. The Mac... It just worksThis is maybe the ultimate reason a mac owner will give you to explain why it's superior to a PC. The mac owner will tell you that all people that own macs are really satisfied with their computers and would never switch back. This is ofcourse not true.The mac owner will also tell you that with a system from Apple you will never have to think about drivers, upgrades or anything. A mac is perfection itself when delivered. Atleast according to their standard. Many macs can't even be upgraded. So what you buy is what you get. Expect your system to be outdated within 1-2 years.Apple also states: \"Only with a Mac do you get an operating system built by the same people who built the computer it runs on.\". Actually Apple's Mac OS X (the operating system) is not based on their own technology, but by the technology of freeBSD. Apple's own capabilities in form of creating an operating system have been demonstrated in previous versions of Mac OS. It took an operating system based on someone else's technology to get a Mac multitasking and not behaving like an oversized pocket calculator from 1985.2. It doesn't crashYes it does! And it does it alot. The difference between a pc based on Windows crashing and a Mac is that on the pc the crash is in 99% of the cases caused by badly coded third party software, when the Mac just has a faulty operating system. Why else would Apple themselves run their india website on RedHat Linux?There is another fun part about crashes on the mac, it's almost always impossible to trace the source of the crash. When your mac crashes you simply reinstall the system. Sounds like a fun thing to do on your spare time, well buy a Mac then!3. Simply the best in digital musicThis point is actually based on Apple's iPod. I must admit, the iPod is not an ugly creation. I'll give Apple credit for that. But as always, they exaggerate the benefits of their product. Apple was far from first with creating a portable mp3-player with a built in harddrive but on the other side they do offer the most expensive solution.The iPod is about 40-60% more expensive than technologically equal products. Keep in mind also that it offers no recording option and no belt clip. Two very crucial benefits a portable mp3-player should have.4. The missing link in digital photographyIt's amazing! Apple has invented a program called iPhotos that will revolutionize the way we look at digital photos. Hear what they have to say: \"Simply drag your mouse, and iPhoto magically grows or shrinks your photo thumbnails. So you can view individual shots in detail or see hundreds of photos on the screen at once...\".Maybe mac users are new to digital photos on the computer but on the pc we have a huge variety of freeware that does the job of iPhoto and more, to choose from. So when Apple says that they are \"the missing link in digital photography\" maybe what they meant was that iPhoto is the missing link of the Mac.Windows users reached that stage of evolution ages ago.5. Your own digital entertainment centerIt seems that Apple thinks that they've revolutionized computing by developing mediocre software for viewing digital photos, editing video, burning CDs and DVDs and listening to music. Well they haven't!6. Goes everywhere you goYou better sit down for this one, hold on to your seat and embrace yourself for some cutting edge news from Apple... they've invented the laptop, eureka! Not only that, they think they've made it superior to other laptops. Let's look at why and also try to answer their questions:    * Can your PC laptop go coast to coast with just one battery?      \u2014 Ofcourse. And if it only needs the performance of the Mac it could probably go around the world.    * Can you put the system to sleep just by closing the lid?      \u2014 Oh my god, a Mac can do that? Well, so can a PC!    * Does it wake up instantly?      \u2014Duh!    * Can your PC laptop automatically switch between Ethernet,      dial-up and wireless connections on the fly?      \u2014Without a doubt!    * Without a restart?      Is this a joke? This really proves that Apple has no clue on what their competitors are doing. If they never have used a PC running Windows it makes their tests and objective sayings about the Mac really credible. Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic.7. It's built for the internetApple makes a huge point about the easability of configuring an internet connection on a mac. All new Windows versions come with just as easy to use guides for connecting to the internet with modem, lan or anything else. They also brag about such obvious tools of communication like email, favorites and contacts. Yes Apple, this is really new and hot stuff, you are indeed innovative. Or maybe not.The worst part might be that they lie about their under average video-plugin Quicktime. This might be one of the worst programs ever to install. Actually if some students at a university needed an example of a really poorly written program, this would be a perfect opportunity for Quicktime to step into the limelight.8. Office is Office, and then someYes, the mac comes with Office and this is why you should make the switch from a pc to a mac:\"The transition to a Mac is easy in part because you\u2019ll continue using the same applications you already know\"Ask yourself this: Why would I switch when It's the exactly same on the mac? -Beats me. Apple does speak of some mysterious features in this sentence:\"And thanks to exclusive features, the Mac versions improve on their Windows counterparts\"As you might expect they mention nothing on what these features are. Well they're probably just wonderfully, perfectly and amazingly non-existent!9. Works effortlessly with PCsApple thought for a long time that they'd be best off constructing their own method for network-communication. Everyone that has struggled with the glorious AppleTalk knows that they didn't do a great job. Now they have realised that it's better to use an already working technology that someone else created instead of poorly reinventing the wheel.\"Networking on a Mac is built on the same technologies used by PCs.\"They also reveal amazing means of medias you can use on your mac:...\"you can also swap files via data CD, floppies or Zip disks.\"10. It's beautifulApple emphasises that all their products are masterpieces of design. Their problem is that their focus on design hinders them from creating ergonomical and practical machines. If you have ever used the small round iMac mouse you have probably too suffered from aches in arm and hand.\"...ergonomic products that are the toast of the design world...\"It wasn't I who brought up the word toast into the debate. On the other hand it was I who drew the paralell to machines looking like plain household machines. Who wants a computer that looks like a remnant from the 70's? You could probably achieve the same state of hallucination that you could by inhaling large amounts of heavy drugs.So what have we learned from these 10 points that Apple provides for the potential buyer. We have learned that Apple likes to tell their future customers that the mac is built on technology they probably already are using on their PCs. They also lure the extremely naive buyers with words like internet, word-processing and cd-burning.Please do not be fooled. You have nothing to gain by switching to a Mac. Apple has proved it on their own, with a little help from us.", "example" : "You Macintosh users just need to face that your OS sucks.

It seems everybody has thier personal version of mafia's history. I am Sicilian and the study of the Mafias (we prefer plural vs one single mafia) is one of my interests, as a Sicilian and as a student. Also... I'm no member of any \"family\" you may think of.The word itself has rather obscure origins, and its history and meaning is totally unrelated with modern concept of mafia.Modern Mafias have so many different aspects I couldn't say if one is wronger than others. Nowadays the term \"Mafia\" can be rightly (and sadly) related to almost every socio-political aspect of our lives. We could say the word itself has gained a more general and complex meaning since its migration from Sicily to USA.As regards the word itself: its origin can be traced back in the centuries. Sure it had something to do with the many invasions Sicily was exposed to. During the ages, Sicily has been invaded by pretty much ALL of the peoples in the Mediterranean Area: Greeks, Romans, Normands (~French), Arabs, Spanish, Italians nowadays. This gave the island's culture an inmense richness, but as a side effect created among Sicilians some sort of silent \"brotherhood\" against anyone coming from the outside world.This \"brotherhood\", meaning protection of the masses from the invasors, lately degenerated into an oppression of the masses. The term mafia, originally indicating (not meaning) a group of people \"respected\" for being charismatic  members of that brotherhood, slightly but inesorably turned into a synonym for organized crime.My personal idea is that the two different meanings still coexist in Sicilian culture, often originating a confusig and ambiguous mix.As regards the \"international\" meaning... well I guess everybody has a very distorted prespective, maybe the best definition is \"Those loud mouth Italian criminals talking with gestures like in the class A movie The Godfather\"!", "example" : "Sicilian never say the word \"mafia\". really, I never heard a Sicilian call it mafia.

In the past, Italian was the official language of Malta, but when the English took over Malta in the 1930s, English almost completely replaced Italian in everyday speech (although television and most other media remains in Italian). However, in addition to this, the Maltese language (a mixture of Southern Italian dialects and other various mediterranean tongues) was used. In recent years, the Maltese language has rapidly began to decline, with more and more people there speaking English as the language of choice. Maltese is a \"working\" language of the European Union, but is not given the same status (yet) as the other languages, simply due to the shortage of people who speak it. Its status is in some ways compareable to that of Welsh in Wales, where English has gradually displaced its usage. During an average Maltese conversation, English, Italian, and Maltese will all be intermixed without a second thought. This process is known as \"code-switching\". In doing this, the Maltese people are being \"imprinted\" with English and Italian words, and are entering them into the Maltese language. In this way, the Maltese language will eventually become an Italianized form of English if current trends continue. For example, the Maltese word \"Bibljoteka\" (the 'j' in Maltese is pronounced as an 'i' by the way, so it's like \"biblioteka\") means library. However, the Maltese have joined the English word for this - Library - with an Italian ending - \"eria\", to form the \"new Maltese\" word, \"Libreria\", which is a combination of Italian and English. The word \"Libreria\" has now displaced \"bibljoteka\" almost completly; so much so that the younger generations often do not even realise that \"bibljoteka\" is a Maltese word. This trend seems to be continuing throughout much of the Maltese language. There are two main different dialects of Maltese. One is this \"Italo-Anglicized\" one, with italian and english influences growing every day, and is spoken by the rich or those living in urban areas. Those who live on the countryside however (not that there is much of it anymore in Malta), speak a \"lesser\" form of Maltese, which sounds more like some of the Eastern Mediterranean languages rather than anything else. However, this \"lesser\" Maltese is in decline, as the other is increasingly considered 'Standard'.", "example" : "*I am Maltese*I can speak Maltese*The Maltese word for Maltese is \"Malti\"", "word" : "maltese"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltha"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malthas"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malthe"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malthene"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malthite"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malthouse"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malthus"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malthusian"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malthusianism"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malthusiast"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malty"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltier"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltiest"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltine"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltiness"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malting"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltman"},{"definition" : "Something so incredible, it would cause Stephen Hawking to actually say \"Hax!\"", "example" : "Guy 1: Those ninja just killed stole the A-Team van without BA Barrachus noticing!Guy 2: That's so malto!", "word" : "malto"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltobiose"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltodextrin"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltodextrine"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltol"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltols"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltolte"},{"definition" : "Sugar form of \"malto\".", "example" : "He's so awesome, his maltose level is 200!", "word" : "maltose"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltoses"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltreat"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltreated"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltreating"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltreatment"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltreatments"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltreator"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltreats"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malts"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltster"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltsters"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malturned"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "maltworm"},{"definition" : "the ship name of michael clifford and calum hood which ladies individual is great but you know together ever better", "example" : "'omg i ship malum!''lashton all the way!1!'", "word" : "malum"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malunion"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malurinae"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malurine"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malurus"},{"definition" : "To be an awesome guy", "example" : "Man im so awesome im like malus", "word" : "malus"},{"definition" : "the pengest latina you\u2019ll eva meet trussss fucking hell", "example" : "ay did you see malva damnnn", "word" : "malva"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malvaceae"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malvaceous"},{"definition" : "malval means the power to see the future with the power from within spiritual assistance.\n\nalso means a song delight, sung to praise the power of God", "example" : "(prophet malval)", "word" : "malval"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malvales"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malvasia"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malvasian"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malvasias"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malvastrum"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malversation"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "malverse"},{"definition" : "A place you take a crap when you have nowhere else to go.", "example" : "Dude, pull over.

New Manba is circling back around into previous Yamanba style only without the hawaiian leis. Armed with an even darker tan than any previous gal style, hair is usually dyed so much in so many colors that it breaks like glass; Other times the gals stay raven haired or just go blonde. Hair is teased, backcombed, and hair sprayed super big. Make up is thick contrasting black and white with the white strip down almost to the bottom of the nose. NO MORE STICKERS on the face (but I heard that they're coming back), sometimes colored eye shadows. Very shiny, flashy, lots of glitter and false eyelashes as always, but now some with gemstones and neon colors. As for the clothes: just as flashy as the hair and make up: bright T's, rave style clothes, mini skirts, tutu's, hot pants, high heels, slippers. Some common accessories are feather boas, big bows, some still wear flowers in their hair.(old)If you goggle \"ganguro\"this is probably what will pop up on your screen. It's not right, but it's also not very wrong either. Also comes from the term Yamanba. This style make-up wise, is pretty much the exact same as Yamanba except that the make is much more powdery, better blended and the white was beginning to migrate up onto the forehead. The clothing is Alba Rosa, Cocolulu and fairly non-beach related. Short skirts and platform heels were practically the uniform. Hawaiian leis were still common but most gals only wore one as a necklace and maybe a bracelet; as opposed to Yamanba who wore tons. Often, most old manba's were blonde and had randomly placed pastel-colored extensions, though some stayed raven-haired and some stayed true to the crazy yamanba haircolor like teal and purple. Some more common hair accessories were plastic princess tiaras and hibiscus flowers.

It is an ancient art that has been used for centuries as a form of entertainment. It's basicallt Japanese comic books, which can be easily translated to English. However, just saying manga are comics from Japan is wrong.First of all, in the US and in Europe, most comics are addressed to young children between the ages of 9 and 13. That is not the case of manga. There are 6-7 major types of manga, each having its own audience. Kodomo manga is for children. Shonen manga is for boys ages 12-18 , Shoujo manga is for gilrs age 12-18. Josei manga is for adult ladies above the age of 20, mainly working women. Seinen manga is for young men between the ages of 18 and 30, and Hentai manga is pornographic, adult manga.As you can see, saying \"comics from Japan\" is wrong. Another difference between manga and Western comics is that each comics volume has its own plot, while manga volumes all follow the same plot. The artwork is VERY different.

It's capital is Winnipeg (or \"The Peg\"). All Winnipegers will tell you that the city is named after Winnie the Pooh.Some do not recognize Manitoba as a valid province because moose outnumber people five to one.

The snow trucks and streetsweepers manage to scoop most of their body parts away. * Manitoba is the first province to give women the vote (way back in 1916) which is why you don't even wanna THINK about fucking with Manitoba chicks. They will slice you.* At just over a million people, the population is far too low to have a murder rating. One murder to a Manitoban would be like... the holocaust. So it just doesn't happen despite the myths you've heard.* Most Manitobans live only in its capital, Winnipeg, and three-quarters of Manitoba is a superlarge Indian reservation. Oddly enough, casinos are everywhere but this  may be an unrelated phenomenon.* Manitobans made seperatism and speaking French cool before it became the fashion in Quebec.* Some drunken half-Native, half-French dude named Louis Riel founded Manitoba. He kicked major whitey ass. He would slice you too just like the Manitoban chicks if you pissed him off.* Manitobans speak a unique dialect of English which is a special blend of French, Ukrainian and Elvish. Eg: \"Borrow me that book\" means \"Lend me that book\". \"This city sucks!\" means \"I really love my motherland!\".* The main religion is Goth. Second is atheism.* Cool Manitobans live in a place called \"Osborne Village\" which is filled with gays, hippies, goths and s&m rubber fetishists. * While Northern Manitoba may very well have igloos, the Greater Winnipeg area has real buildings made of materials other than ice, like wood, stone and concrete.* Licence plates read \"Friendly Manitoba\" and they _are_ friendly to everyone except the KKK and snobby brats with a silver spoon in their mouths and who have fake dyed blond hair who came from Vancouver and then complain that they hate being stuck in Winnipeg because it's nothing like Vancouver, blah, blah, blah, go die.Overall, rather than being the stinky butthole of the country, it is an unappreciated jewel trapped in the bowels of the remote prairie nougat core of North America.", "example" : "\"Manitoba... is that a drink?\"\"Is Manitoba even real?
