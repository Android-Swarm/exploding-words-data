These spots are caused by destruction or weakening of the pigment cells in those areas, resulting in the pigment being destroyed or no longer produced. In most cases, vitiligo is believed to be an autoimmune-related disorder. Although researchersare not exactly sure what causes the autoimmune response, more is being learned every year. In vitiligo, only the color of the skin is affected. The texture and other skin qualities remain normal.People who develop vitiligo usually first notice white patches or spots (depigmentation) on their skin. The skin remains of normal texture, and there is usually no itching or other symptoms. These patches are more obvious in sun-exposed areas, including the hands, feet, arms, legs, face, and lips. Other common areas for white patches to appear are the armpits and groin and around the mouth, eyes, nostrils, navel, and genitals. Vitiligo generally appears in one of three patterns. In one pattern (focal pattern), the depigmentation is limited to one or only a few areas. Some people develop depigmented patches on only one side of their bodies (segmental vitiligo). But for most people who have vitiligo, depigmentation occurs on different parts of the body (generalized vitiligo), often similar on each side of the body. In addition to white patches on the skin, some people with vitiligo may experience white hair growing in on the scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows, and beard. In extremely rare cases, vitiligo can affect eye color or the pigment of the retina.Most people with vitiligo have neither parents, nor children, nor siblings with vitiligo. Many have no other relatives with vitiligo. Vitiligo does appear to be hereditary, that is, it can run in families. Children whose parents have the disorder are more likely to develop vitiligo. There is no question about that. However, most children will not get vitiligo even if a parent has it, and most people with vitiligo do not have a family history of the disorder. So the chances of your child developing vitiligo appear to be very small. Nevertheless, there are sufficient numbers of families where vitiligo does appear among siblings, parents and children, such that we can assume a genetic factor.The beginning of Vitiligo and the severity of pigment loss differs with each patient. Light skinned people usually notice the pigment loss during the summer as the contrastbetween the vitiliginous skin and the suntanned skin becomes distinct. People with dark skin may observe the onset of Vitiligo at any time. Individuals who have severe cases will lose pigment over their entire body surface. There is noway to predict how much pigment an individual will lose, Illness and stress can result in more pigment loss. The degree of pigment loss can also vary within each Vitiligo patch, and a border of abnormally dark skin may encircle a patch of depigmented skin.Vitiligo frequently begins with a rapid loss of pigment which may be followed by a lengthy period when the skin color does not change. Later, the pigment loss may resume \u2014 perhaps after the individual has suffered physical trauma or stress. The loss of color may continue until, for unknown reasons, the process stops. Cycles of pigment loss, followed by periods of stability may continue indefinitely. It is rare for a patient with Vitiligo to repigment or regain skin color spontaneously. Most patients who say that they no longer have Vitiligo may actually have become depigmented and are no longer bothered by contrasting skin color. While such patients appear to be \u201ccured\u201d, they really are not. People who have Vitiligo all over their bodies do not look like albinos because the color of their hair may not change \u2014 or it can be dyed \u2014 and eye color does not change.Most individuals with Vitiligo are upset because of the uneven skin color. It is difficult for those who do not have Vitiligo to appreciate the significance of this problem to the victim.If a person has Vitiligo over more than half of the exposed areas of the body, he or she is not a candidate for repigmentation. Rather, such a person may want to try depigmentation of the remaining pigmented skin. The drug for depigmentation is monobenzylether of hydroquinone. Many patients with Vitiligo are at first apprehensive about the idea of depigmentation and reluctant to go ahead. However, patients who achieve complete depigmentation are usually satisfied with the end results. Some people become allergic to the medication and must discontinue therapy. This therapy takes about a year to complete. The pigment removal is permanent.Patches of vitiligo skin have no natural protection against the sun\u2019s rays. This is because vitiligo skin is white as the melanocytes which produce melanin (skin pigment) are not active. The effect of the sun is normally to increase melanin production and to turn the skin brown; this is a protective mechanism to prevent the skin from being damaged by burning. Therefore, the most important reason for protecting your skin is to prevent sunburn. Not only is this painful, but damage to the skin, including sunburn, can stimulate the vitiligo to spread in some people.Most of the people that suffer from this disease have a hard time with people either not believing them about their condition, or just people giving them a hard time about it, especially when they are African American.

A fall is considered hard when the climber falls beyond at least one piece of protection, which in trad climbing would mean the last placed cam or nut and in sport climbing would be the last successfully clipped quickdraw. The term 'whipper' comes from the whipping motion a climber will take if an unskilled belayer cuts the fall short, limiting the dynamic stretching nature of the rope and causing a pendulum effect (often into the wall). It has become ubiquitous, however, with a hard fall, regardless of whether the pendulum effect is achieved or not.Whippers can be very dramatic falls, often for some distance. The distance of a whipper is determined by a number of factors, including rope stretch, any slack in the rope before the climber is ejected, and discrepancies in the relative weights between the climber and the belayer.When a whipper is particularly long and the load great, a belayer will be lifted from the ground, occasionally all the way up to the first piece of protection or bolt. Depending on how far up the route the climber has gone, the climber may fall far enough to meet the belayer at an even level or even pass the belayer on the way down. This effect is known as teabagging in the rock climbing community, and is most common when a climber is significantly heavier than their belayer, but can happen in various other circumstances as well.Dynamic rope is very well-suited to handle whippers, which can often be dramatically long and put a great deal of strain on a rope and equipment. Dynamic rope is rated by the UIAA to handle a specific number of whippers before being retired.", "example" : "www.takethewhipper.org", "word" : "whipper"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "whipperginny"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "whippers"},{"definition" : "A term generally used by old persons, to insult the younger generation.", "example" : "Get off my damn lawn you whippersnappers!", "word" : "whippersnapper"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "whippersnappers"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "whippertail"},{"definition" : "The huff of nitrous oxide (NO) left in a carefully managed can of Reddi Wip after all the cream is gone.Whipped-cream-in-a-can is propelled by nitrous oxide.

Best Education System in Fairfield CountyAlthough people really forget about this fact, Wilton does have the best public schools in Fairfield County (see the CT Magazine ratings every year) and I'm sure thats the only reason why my parents continue to tolerate living here. While at Wilton I have had some excellent teachers; two of my teachers have a PhD in their respective fields. 2. Good PartiesAs in any small town in fairfield county the parties are damn good.3. Good sportsYes, our sports teams are good too. Field Hockey and Girls soccer won States this year. Lax teams are perineal winners. 4. Some Genuine PeopleIn order to live in Wilton, you must have money. Which means you must have a pretty good education right? (excluding stay at home moms) Within this group of people there are some very interesting people who dont just care about money. It is possible to survive in wilton as a non-business professional. You dont have to be bloody rich as in New Canaan or Darien, and I think that preserves some semblance of normalcy. 5. Short Drive to New YorkCommuting to New York takes a little over an hour.Very nice.Bad Things1. SuperficialityI dont know if people in Wilton are truly happy. Most pour all their money into their huge house renovations, expensive cars, country club memberships and 120 dollar haircuts and yet we have a huge rate of domestic violence incidents. Go figure. The only thing holding together half of the families in Wilton is the fact that the husband makes over 200,000 dollars a year.2. Nothing to doThere isnt really anything to do here. Thats why everyone drinks and smokes. The teen center is a huge bust. Hey, but at least some kids got a resume booster out of it.3. Open mindedness?There are way too many conservative people in this town and the surrounding areas. I respect being conservative for religious reasons, but most people here love the padding that the tax cut gives them. There is definitely a huge stoner-chill out contingent within the highschool but most of these are not stoner-intellectuals, the majority are stoner-waste of lifes. 4. Pre-professional PressureThere is tremendous pressure on the kids here to do really well in school, and get into an elite college. Most of the kids that are accepted to the elite schools are brilliant and self-motivated, proving that this pressure is unnecessary and ineffective.On the whole, Wilton is suprisingly not as bad as New Canaan, Darien and Greenwich which epitomize Preppy-snobbyness and old money.

America has pushed the once wide spread population of wolves through out the States back to ranges in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and Canada. Wolves are also suffering in the eastern world except in Russia and Siberia where numbers are constant.Wolves have a pack system that every wolf in the world seems to abide by; the alpha pair eats first and always lead the pack when relocating. The beta pair step in to the alpha\u2019s position if something happens to the male or both of the wolves, they eat second and act as protectors for the alpha whilst they eat and put any wolf challenging the alpha back in line. The last of all of is the omega, this wolf is very timed and acts as a look out whilst the other wolves are eating and when they leave, they may eat the remains (usually stomach content.) Wolves tend to hunt and feed on rabbits, elk, deer and sometimes on buffalo and moose.
