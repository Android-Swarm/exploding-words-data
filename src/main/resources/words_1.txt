Lives in drainpipes and grease pits surrounding high schools and universities. The origins of the abomination goes something like this: a giant plague infested sewer rat rapes an AIDS carrying orangutan, in the ass, while in the restroom of a 747. The orangutan proceeds to shit out the ass baby that was conceived. The baby abomination  gets ejected out of the plane along with a large amount of shit. While falling, the abomination gets hit by lightning and catches fire. Upon reaching the ground, the flaming abomination slams into a mountain side at terminal velocity and then rolls down the side, hitting every rock on the way down. Baby Bom-Bom then reaches a cliff where it falls off, still on fire, and lands on the ugly tree, where it falls hitting every branch on the way down. It then falls into a campground, still on fire, where a family proceeds to beat it with sticks and stomp it out with their golf cleats. They then dump it into an outhouse that has a good 20 ft of shit in the bottom. Here the abomination matures, stewing in the shit of countless years.Finally, the Abomination crawled out and made its home in the sewer system of a small north Georgia town. The power of its ugliness attract other uglies like a magnet, so there is an excess amount of nasty in this town. Seriously, this thing is so ugly that you will want to die when you see it. Its smell is indescribable, but this scenario may help. Take a very hairy, nasty, diseased, fat ,sweaty man with chronic diarrhea and then take a blow dryer to his ass. The warm air that cames off resembles the stench of the abomination. Has a bad case of not shutting the fuck up and hair loss, but only on top of the head. Frequently likes to show off its ass crack which the sight and smell of kills  unprepared people.

In a newspaper ad of 1769 the two Henriod sisters from Neuchatel, Switzerland, advertised their remedy \"Bon Extrait d'Absinthe\" which consisted of alcohol, wormwood, aniseed, lemon balm and other herbs. This formula was later distributed by a certain Dr. Ordinaire \u2013 and the success story of the \"Green Fairy\" was born. Around the year 1800 the formula was sold to Mr. H. L. Pernod of Pontarlier, France, where a minor production line was started and helped Pernod to gain a fame that lasted until our present time.During the Algier War in the 19th century France made use of the inciting effects of Absinthe and provided the Soldiers with regular rations of the liquor. The veterans who had survived this war soon pushed the production output from 400 liters daily (appr. 90 gallons) to more than 20.000 liters (appr. 5.000 gallons) a day and more. Absinthe distilleries started to spread all over France like mushrooms.However, artists and intellectuals of those times were the ones especially devoted to Absinthe. Many great works of contemporary art owe their existence to the inspiring effects of the spirit. Great names like Baudelaire, Manet, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Oscar Wilde, Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, van Gogh, Gauguin and Picasso are found among these early adepts of Absinthe.For different reasons around 1910 the total turnover of Absinthe distribution had reached immeasurable peaks. Many distilleries made use of low-grade alcohol which in some not too rare cases caused blindness among the consumers. These irresponsible dealings with the drink finally resulted in the prohibition of Absinthe in (almost) all countries of Europe by the year 1920.Since in 1981 (and again in 1998) the European Community has returned to legalizing the production and distribution of Absinthe, the cult around this drink has experienced a true revival.

Fatalism is the type of theater Beckett wrote (Waiting for Godot, End Game), where man is trapped in life, even basic communication is cut off. Existentialism is that if there is no point, at least you can rationalize an existance, No Exit is an example of this. Hilarious is the type Ionesco wrote (The Lesson), based off the Neitzsche prinicpal that man invented laughter to keep sanity.

To practice acupuncture, acupuncturists use fine needles to stimulate several key points in the body that is called \u201ctsubo\u201d in Japanese. These points (tsubos) were found from hundreds and hundreds of years of practices and experiences. Different points (tsubos) stimulations and their combinations have different effects. Historically there are several acupunctures known in Japan such as \u201cOgasawara-ryu\u201d in Edo and \u201cKiyamachi no Hari\u201d in Kyoto.  Our body has developed since origin of life and in the middle of evolution to maintain our body to survive as possible.   In modern sciences and medicine, it is known that there are homeostasis mechanisms that try to keep our body balanced and consistent.  As one result, immune systems might have evolved in animals. We also know that there are massive networks of nerve system in our body. These fields are under intensive scientific researches and we know and accumulated massive knowledge in last a few centuries.  Although we know a lot about homeostasis, immune systems, and nerve systems etc. but we do not know more than we know.  In another word, we do NOT know everything and we have plenty of unknowns in nature that's why we are now continuously discovering and exploring the nature in our body and our universe.  One important \u201cgoal in medicine is cure people\u201d. Acupuncture works well with certain diseases. In acupuncture, stimulations in several points (tsubos) in several body parts that could coordinate and stimulate our bodies try to keep balanced and stimulate our homeostatic capabilities. As the nature of acupuncture that could be assisting body's curing power itself, acupuncture may be more natural but may not be almighty (so as modern medicine).  For example, against acute infections, antibody and drug treatments could be more significantly effective, although acupuncture may be able to assist immune system and homeostasis.However, it may be wise to take advantages of what could be good for people\u2019s health rather than simply deny everything judging from only what we now know.In future, it is important to find out the mechanisms to fill the gaps between practices and effects what are behind in acupuncture with modern scientific terms that is still lacking or very limited at the moment.", "example" : "Acupuncture works well with several diseases.", "word" : "acupuncture"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "acupunctured"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "acupuncturing"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "acupuncturist"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "acupuncturists"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "acurative"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "acus"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "acusection"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "acusector"},{"definition" : "Irish for 'darling'.

Agnostics will often question the existence of a supreme power because a lot of modern religious beliefs have no basis in modern logic; therefore blind following of popular religions is viewed as an easy out for people who chose not to think for themselves. Agnostics on atheism: On the other end of the spectrum, unlike atheists, an agnostic uses a more scientific approach to their belief system. An agnostic knows that just because there is no physical proof of the existence of a higher being, it dose not automatically mean that one does not exist. An agnostic views an atheist on the same plane as a religious zealot; often because the belief that human beings are the pinnacle of intelligence and there are few things that we do not or have the potential to understand.The realization of knowing that \u201cwe cannot know everything\u201d is the backbone of the agnostic belief.", "example" : "Christian Zealot: God loves you and everyone.

It´s also the biggest club with approximately 17 000 members. Here is a short recapture of what has happened since the club was founded in 1891.The foundation of AIK took place on 15th February 1891 in Stockholm. The name is an abbreviation for \"Allmänna Idrottsklubben\", which in direct translation means \"The general sports club\". The name was choosen to indicate that the club was open for everyone and also that one of the main events was to be athletics, at that time called \"allmän idrott\" in Swedish.Indeed AIK were successful in athletics winning no less than 26 Swedish championship titles before the section was defunct in 1916. In 1908 the club set an official world record at 4x200 metres.AIK also competed in a number of other sports, among them fencing, skating, cycling, wrestling, gymnastics etc. In 1896 the first attempts in football took place and as early as in 1900 AIK became champions.The present club badge was created in 1898. Later on it was considered \"The most beautiful badge in the world\" after a contest in London that included badges from England, Spain, Italy and France.Between 1900 and 1923 AIK became Swedish champions in football six times. During the 20's the club recieved its nickname \"Gnaget\" (translated: the gnaw). The reason is believed to be the colours of the black shirts, that after too many washes turned rat-alike (grey). Supporters of AIK are called \"Gnagare\" (translated: rodents).That same decade the first edition of the Swedish premier league in football \"Allsvenskan\" was introduced and AIK were of course one of the founder members. Since then the team has played in Allsvenskan all seasons but three. Also the first attempts in icehockey took place.The 30's was the most successful decade (so far) in the history of AIK. In bandy AIK were crowned champions for the third time, the football side twice won the title and in icehockey the three first championship titles were captured.For the next three decades it was the \"smaller\" sections in AIK that contributed to the glory. AIK won championships in handball, skating, bowling, badminton and tennis.During the 70's AIK started women's team in football, bandy and bowling. In 1974 the King of Sweden, His majesty King Carl XVI Gustaf, became AIK's patron and first member of honour.In 1982 the icehockey team won the championship for the first time in 35 years and repeated the feat two years later.In 1992 it was in football that AIK won an eagerly awaited title - champions for the first time in 55 years. Six years later that achievement was repeated. To that could be added three Cup-titles between 1996 and 1999. The most successful team in the last decades however, has been the women's team in bandy with nine championships between 1988 and 2004.AIK have been represented in a number of sports throughout the years winning over 170 Swedish championship titles. In the late 80's AIK competed in only four sports: football, icehockey, bandy and bowling.
