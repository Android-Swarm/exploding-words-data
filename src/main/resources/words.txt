In the cases when they form words in their own right, the period is omitted, for example, hippo = hippopotamus, limo = limousine. Such shortenings are often but not always informal. Some become the standard forms, and the full forms are then regarded as formal or technical, for example, bus = omnibus, taxi = taxicab, deli = delicatessen, zoo = zoological garden. Sometimes shortenings are altered to facilitate their pronunciation or spelling: bike = bicycle2 Contractions are abbreviated forms in which letters from the middle of the full form have been omitted, for example, Dr. = doctor, St. = saint or street. Such forms are invariably followed by a period. Another kind of contraction is the type with an apostrophe marking the omission of letters: can't = cannot, didn't = did not, you've = you have. 3 Initialisms are made up of the initial letters of words and are pronounced as separate letters: CIA (or C.I.A.), NYC, pm (or p.m.), U.S. (or US). Practice varies with regard to periods, with current usage increasingly in favor of omitting them, especially when the initialism consists entirely of capital letters. 4 Acronyms are initialisms that have become words in their own right, or similar words formed from parts of several words. They are pronounced as words rather than as a series of letters, for example, AIDS, laser, scuba, UNESCO, and do not have periods. In many cases the acronym becomes the standard term and the full form is only used in explanatory contexts.", "example" : "An abbr. is a shortened form of a word or phrase.", "word" : "Abbr."},{"definition" : "Common abbreviation for `abbreviation'.", "example" : "/*-breev'/, /*-brev'/ ........", "word" : "abbrev"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "abbreviatable"},{"definition" : "Idk - I don\u2019t knowIdc - I don\u2019t careIdm - I don\u2019t mind\n\nIdr - I don\u2019t rememberIdrm - I don\u2019t really mindRly / rlly - reallySme / sm - samelol -laughing out loud\n\nLmao - laughing my ass off\n\nWtf - what the fuckWTH - what the heckLmfao - laughing my fucking ass offKys - kill your-selfKms - kill my-selfPls / plz - pleaseye / yea - yes / yeahSo - significant other / shoutoutBf & gf - boyfriend & girlfriend\n\nSmh - shaking my headCos / cuz / cus / cause - becauseOmg - oh my godOml - oh my lordPic - pictureWyd / wud - what you doingWywd / wuwd - what you wanna doU - you\n\nTb - text backNr / nrs - no reply(s)Bro - brotherNm - nothing muchNvm - never mindDm - direct message / doesn\u2019t matterTbh - to be honestM8 - mateProb / probs - probablyLy - love you\n\nLysm - love you so muchLysfm - love you so fucking muchLyl - love you loadsLy2 - love you tooGn - good-nightGm - good-morningJk - just kiddingJw - just wonderingPpl - people", "example" : "Oml I\u2019m lmao cos my gf just posted the cutest pic of my dog but I\u2019m smh cos the dog is shitting like wtf lol\n\nJohn - Yo Dave wyd broDave - nm u?John - sme, I\u2019m so bored\n\nDave - wuwd then?John - idk and idm tbhDave - sme hereDave - hello??Dave - John!?Dave - tb when u get this thenSee - abbreviations", "word" : "Abbreviations"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "abbreviatory"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "abbreviature"},{"definition" : null, "example" : null, "word" : "abbroachment"},{"definition" : "American Born Chinese", "example" : "Man, he ain't azn, he's ABC.", "word" : "ABC"},{"definition" : "Cindy's reason for not attending family functions.", "example" : "He doesn't need to know, but I have an abcess on my woohoo.
